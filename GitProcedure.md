Procedural documentation for using Git and GitHub by the RCLM. Written and compiled by Caitlin Postal.

(IN PROGRESS)

## User Interface
Be prepared to use the "GitHub Desktop" app or the command line. Please do not upload any materials through the browser-based GUI.

Git is complex. This guide will document a step-by-step procedure for RCLM team members to follow. If you run into an issue while using Git and GitHub, please contact the technical team (Kelly Mahaffy and Caitlin Postal).

## Work Sessions

At the beginning of every work session, use "Fetch origin" to clone the most up to date repository.

branch

Save changes locally as frequently as possible.

Commit changes locally as necessary after saving. To do this, first navigate to Source Control in your text editor (ctrl+shift+g in Visual Studio Code). Using the file name under the "Changes" dropdown, click the plus to "Stage Changes." The file name will now be under the "Staged Changes" dropdown. To commit locally, click the check mark to the right of "Source Control" (above the "Staged Changes" and "Changes" dropdown menus).

At the end of every work session, save your changes locally first.
