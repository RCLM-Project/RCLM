<h1 style="color:#b30000">Coding Languages Cheat Sheet</h1>

<p>One common problem in Digital Humanities projects is that it can be difficult to identify what technical or coding skills will be necessary for a project. It is not that people with the correct skill sets don't exist, but rather that it is unclear what skills will be necessary for a project to succeed. For those without coding or web development experience, it can be extremely difficult to translate the plan of a project into functional skills needed to bring that project to completion. This coding cheat sheet is one way that the RCLM team hopes to help solve this problem.</p>
<br>
<p>This coding "cheat sheet" is meant to provide a general overview of what each coding language is used for, which other languages are commonly used in partnership with others, and the types of projects that each coding language could be used to complete. While this information is by no means comprehensive, we hope that it will be useful in defining the goals of your project and which skills will be needed to meet those goals.</p>
<br>
<p>It is also important to remember that, when it comes to softwares commonly used for DH projects, the technical requirements very dramatically. Some softwares require extensive coding, but more often than not programs that use a GUI (graphical user interface- a user-centric interface within which projects can be completed) require very minimal to no coding. If you are planning a project that only utilizes pre-existing softwares, you should investigate those programs individually to see what coding proficiencies they recommend. These requirements will likely be different for DH focused softwares like Tableau which requires little to no coding proficiency and more general softwares like Wordpress which really flourishes when used by someone with HTML and CSS proficiency.</p>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">HTML</h3>
For many digital humanists, HTML is the most recognizable coding language. HTML is not only powerful, it is also fairly intelligible for even new coders because of its recognizable tagging system.
<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Creation of website</li>
<li>Minimal text formatting (like the text on this page)</li>
<li>Linking from one website or webpage to another</li></ul>

<h5>Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>CSS</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">CSS</h3>
While CSS is typically not strictly required in partinership with HTML, it provides a lot of functionality during website creation. Many of the things that you would code with CSS can be done in HTML, but any highly specialized or intricate style details must be coded in CSS.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Provides a style guide for HTML code</li>
<li>Can be used to add aesthetic features</li></ul>

<h5>Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>HTML</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">Javascript</h3>
Javascript is known in the digital humanities world for how counterintuitive it is. Unlike HTML and CSS, Javascript is not intelligible to new coders or those unfamiliar with the language because of its complex syntax and abbreviation system.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Add function to websites:</li>
  <ul><li>Create popups</li>
    <li>Collect and Use Payment Information</li>
    <li>Code Complex buttons</li>
    <li>Accessibility features like being able to change the screen colors</li>
    <li>Etc.</li></ul>
  <li>App development</li>
  <li>Website development</li></ul>

  <h5>Commonly Used With:</h5>
  <ul><li> HTML and CSS for Website Development</li>
    <li>Softwares for app development, etc.</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">Java</h3>
While many people use Javascript and Java interchangably, they are in fact different coding languages. You can think of Java as the more complicated (but more powerful) sibling of Javascript. Javascript can do many of the things that Java can as well (but not all), but Java is often a more efficient, powerful, and generalizable option, particularly for writing large programs.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Complex Application Development</li>
  <li>Android Applications</li>
  <li>Scientific Computing</li>
  <li>Advanced scripting</li></ul>

<h5> Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>In isolation</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">Python</h3>
Python has recently taked the coding world by storm and is now the world's most used coding language, in part because it can be used in many ways. If you are looking for a utility code, Python is a great option not only because of its flexibility but also because it works well (or, in the colloquial, "plays nicely") with many other languages.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Website development (on most platforms)</li>
  <li>Data science</li>
  <li>Data visualization</li>
  <li>Game design</li>
  <li>Natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI)</li></ul>

<h5> Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>In isolation</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">R</h3>
Like python, R has become a recent phenom in the coding world. While often not considered by digital humanists because of its roots in data science, there are actually many functions of R that work well with digital humanities projects. Coding in R has become most well known through R Studio, an application that you can use as an interface that provides useful overviews of your data, graphs, etc. in a user-friendly format.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Data Science</li>
  <li>Data visualization</li>
  <li>Working with text and text mining</li>
  <li>Living documents and data sharing</li></ul>

<h5> Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>In isolation</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">Command Line Coding (Shell Coding)</h3>
Shell coding is one of the often forgotten skills that many projects will need at one point or another. The good news is that many of the coding languages described above require at least some knowledge of command line coding even just to install and set up applications used for coding in those languages. This means that most people who have coding skills, particularly those who code in Javascript, Java, Python, and R, liekly know some shell code.</p>
<p>On Macs, command line coding is run out of the terminal and is a way of giving commands to your computers operating system. Unlike the other coding languages which most frequently function on websites, in games, or in applications, command line coding actually "codes" your operating system.
There are many kinds of command line coding. In fact, command line coding is not really a type of code or language, just a common way to refer to a family of coding languages. Instead, the coding languages used on the command line are <b>Shell Languages</b>. The most commonly used shell language is bash (Bourne Again Shell), but other common shell languages include zsh and tcsh. You can also use many of the other coding languages discussed previously in the command line. In fact, the command line is a particularly common way to run Python scripts. All the information here is about bash, but much of it is applicable to all shellcode.</p>

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Accessing OS operations</li>
  <li>Accessing programs and downloads to use other coding languages</li>
  <li>Setting up complex directories and repositories for projects</li></ul>

<h5> Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>Python</li>
<li>GUIs or applications for all other coding languages</li></ul>

<h5 style="color:#b30000">Honorable Mention:</h5>
<h3 style="color:#b30000">GitHub</h3>
While not required for projects, and while used by humanists more widely than any coding languages, many projects might require or benefit from a version control system. For lots of teams, the web developer would also take a lead role in creating and maintaining these version control systems. Though only one option, GitHub is the most common and familiar version control system used today.
A nice feature of GitHub is that it is usable out of a website browser (though I don't recommend it), a desktop GUI, or the command line. For complex operations, you will need knowledge of using Git in the command line, so if your project will use GitHub this is something to ask potential team members and web developers about.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Version Control</li>
  <li>Sharing code, data, files, etc.</li></ul>

<h5> Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>All coding languages</li>
<li>Both code based and non-code based projects</li></ul>
