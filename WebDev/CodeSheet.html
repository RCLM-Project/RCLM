<h1 style="color:#b30000">Coding Languages Cheat Sheet</h1>

<p>One common problem in Digital Humanities projects is not that people with the correct skill sets don't exist, but rather that it is unclear what skills will be necessary for a project to succeed. For those without coding or web development experience, it can be extremely difficult to translate the plan of a project into functional skills needed to bring that project to completion. This coding cheat sheet is one way that the RCLM team hopes to help solve this problem.</p>
<p>This coding cheat sheet gives you a general idea of what each coding language is used for, which other languages are commonly used in unison with others, and the types of projects that each coding language would be used to complete. While this information is by no means comprehensive, we hope that it will be useful in defining the goals of your project and which skills will be needed to meet those goals.</p>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">HTML</h3>
For many digital humanists, HTML is the most recognizable coding language. HTML is not only powerful, it is also fairly intelligible for even new coders because of its recognizable tagging system.
<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Creation of website</li>
<li>Minimal text formatting (like the text on this page)</li>
<li>Linking from one website or webpage to another</li></ul>

<h5>Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>CSS</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">CSS</h3>
While CSS is typically not required, it provides a lot of functionality during website creation. Many of the things that you would code with CSS can be done in HTML as well, but any highly specialized or intricate style details must be coded in CSS.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Provides a style guide for HTML code on websites</li>
<li>Can be used to add all aesthetic features to a website</li></ul>

<h5>Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>HTML</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">Javascript</h3>
Javascript is commonly known in the digital humanities world for how counterintuitive it is. Unlike HTML and CSS, Javascript is not intelligible to new coders or those unfamiliar with the language because of its complex syntax and abbreviation system.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Add function to websites</li>
  <ul><li>Create popup</li>
    <li>Payment Information</li>
    <li>Complex buttons</li>
    <li>Accessibility features like being able to change the screen colors</li>
    <li>Etc.</li></ul>
  <li>App development</li>
  <li>Website development</li></ul>

  <h5>Commonly Used With:</h5>
  <ul><li> HTML and CSS for Website Development</li>
    <li>Softwares for app development, etc.</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">Java</h3>
While many people use Javascript and Java interchangably, they are in fact different coding languages. You can think of Java as the more complicated (but more powerful) sibling of Javascript. Java can do many of the things that Javascript can as well (but not all).

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Complex Application Development</li>
  <li>Android Applications</li>
  <li>Scientific Computing</li>
  <li>Advanced scripting</li></ul>

<h5> Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>In isolation</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">Python</h3>
Python has recently taked the coding world by storm and is now the worlds most used coding language because it can be used in so many ways. If you are looking for a utility code, Python is a great option not only because of its flexibility but also because it works well with many other languages.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Website development (on most platforms)</li>
  <li>Data science</li>
  <li>Data visualization</li>
  <li>Game design</li>
  <li>Natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence(AI)</li></ul>

<h5> Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>In isolation</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">R</h3>
Like python, R has become a recent phenom in the coding world. While often not considered by digital humanists because of its roots in data science, there are actually many functions of R that work well with digital humanities projects. R is also commonly discussed using the name R Studio because of the application in which many people run R called R Studio.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Data Science</li>
  <li>Data visualization</li>
  <li>Working with text and text mining</li>
  <li>Living documents and data sharing</li></ul>

<h5> Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>In isolation</li></ul>

<h3 style="color:#b30000">Command Line Coding (Shell Coding)</h3>
Shell coding is one of the often forgotten skills that many projects will need at one time or another. The good news is that many of the coding languages described above require at least some knowledge of command line coding even just to install and set up applications used commonly with those languages. On Macs, command line coding is run out of the terminal and is a way of giving commands to your computers operating system. Unlike the other coding languages which most frequently function on websites, in games, or in applications, command line coding actually "codes" your operating system.
There are many kinds of command line coding. In fact, command line coding is not really a type of code or language, just a common way to refer to a family of coding languages. Instead, the coding languages used on the command line are <b>Shell Languages</b>. The most commonly used shell language is bash (Bourne Again Shell), but other common shell languages include zsh and tcsh. You can also use many of the other coding languages discussed previously in the command line. In fact, the command line is a particularly common way to run Python scripts. All the information here is about bash, but much of it is applicable to all shellcode.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Accessing OS operations</li>
  <li>Accessing programs and downloads to use other coding languages</li>
  <li>Setting up complex directories and repositories for projects</li></ul>

<h5> Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>Python</li>
<li>GUIs or applications for all other coding languages</li></ul>

<h5 style="color:#b30000">Honorable Mention:</h5>
<h3 style="color:#b30000">GitHub</h3>
While not required for projects, and while used by humanists more widely than any coding languages, many projects might require version control. For lots of teams, the web developer would also take a lead role in creating and manintaingng these version control systems. Though only one option, GitHub is easily the most common and familiar version control system used today.
A nice feature of GitHub is that it is usable out of a website browser (though I don't recommend it), a desktop GUI, or the command line. For complex operations, you will need knowledge of using Git in the command line, so if your project will use GitHub this is something to ask potential team members and web developers about.

<h5>Common Uses:</h5>
<ul><li>Version Control</li>
  <li>Sharing code, data, files, etc.</li></ul>

<h5> Commonly Used With:</h5>
<ul><li>All coding languages</li>
<li>Both code based and non-code based projects</li></ul>
