<h2> Building a Digital Edition: Under the Hood</h2>
<h4>A Short Guide to the Coding and Web Development of the RCLM Project</h4>
<p> The creation of a digital edition is not just translation, TEI or XML encoding, or compiling resources, there is also vital work to be done on making sure that the project functions as a digital project. While it might seem like a last step, the coding and website development of a digital project is where authors can control how a text renders, how readers will interact with it, and code in accessibility features that make the project more usable.</p>
<p>The first step of creating any Digital Humanities project is to identify what you need. Often, this is not a what but rather a who. The truth of any digital humanities project is that one person can rarely if ever support an entire project, and when it comes to coding we often do not even know who or what to look for when considering collaborators. This project narrative looks to begin rectifying this issue by exploring some of the features of the site, how they were constructed, and what is required to create something similar.</p>

<h3> A Project Management System: GitHub</h3>
<h5>Main Uses</h5>
<ul><li>Version Control</li>
  <li>Collaborative Workflow</li>
  <li>Safe Data Storage</li>
  <li>Sharing Data and Project Materials Publically</li></ul>
<h5>Required Coding Knowledge</h5>
<ul><li>None if using the Github.com graphical user interface (GUI) online</li>
  <li>None if using the GitHub Desktop App</li>
  <li>If you are looking to do more advanced work with GitHub, you should consider learning shell coding, likely bash or tsch, which is useful for more advanced functions within GitHub</li></ul>
<p> GitHub is a popular version control system. It can be used as a way to track all versions of a document worked on by all team members. While GitHub is typically thought of as a collaborative tool, it can also be used by smaller teams or single people. The advantage of using GitHub over something like Google Docs is that GitHub stores each version individually, meaning that you can access older versions without overwriting newer ones. It also makes it nearly impossible for collaborators to write over each other's work. When two collaborators happen to edit the same portions of a document, GitHub will flag the documents and ask which changes should be kept.</p>
<p>While most associate GitHub with code, GitHub repositories can actually store many types of files. For humanistic projects, GitHub is useful for storing code, sure, but also for text-based documents, media, and really any other file types. One of the strengths of GitHub is that it can act as a central storage location for varied types of media, something particularly important for a project like the RCLM which generated text documents, photos, code, and kinds of documents for our website. </p>

<p> For many teams, considering what kinds of work (or, perhaps more specifically what kinds of products) you will produce is a great place to start. For the RCLM team, we tried to consider the collaborative aspects of our project from the very get go, and that is where GitHub came in. While Google docs, emailed Word documents, or other lower-tech options existed it was important for our team to create a workflow and system of data sharing that prioritized the unique contributions of each author as well as promoted and protected collaborative work. For our team, this meant that we wanted to use a system that tracked unique contributions of each author while also offering protections against people unwittingly writing over the work of another. Since GitHub is readily available, free, has lots of documentation, and works with all computer types it was the most logical sense to fill these needs.</p>

<h3>A Story In Many Tags: Website Creation via Wordpress</h3>
<h5>Main Uses</h5>
<ul><li>Platform for other work</li>
  <li>Interactive interface for users</li>
  </ul>
<h5>Required Coding Knowledge</h5>
<ul><li>While not strictly required, Wordpress (like basically all prefabricated website building platforms) allows users to customize code if they want to do so, particularly HTML and CSS. For Wordpress specifically, what you can do and how you can make a website look will be extremely limited if you cannot code in HTML and CSS.</li></ul>

<p>After coming up with a workflow that worked for those working with the texts of the RCLM project, website development became the priority from a technical standpoint. There are many things that should be considered when choosing a platform for hosting your project. The RCLM began as a wordpress.com site, which functioned primarily as a proof of concept. It quickly became clear that the limitations of wordpress.com, particularly the lack of access to certain kinds of code and customization, made it a less than ideal place to host the RCLM. Instead, in the summer of 2020, we transitioned from a wordpress.com site to a wordpress.org site. </p>

<p> One thing to know about wordpress.org is that, while it does give much more flexibility and has many more options for customization, it must be hosted somewhere. In short, this means that the websites are not hosted on a Wordpress server (like wordpress.com sites are) but rather have custom domain names and are hosted on your choice of servers. Servers range a lot on cost, restrictions, etc. Our team worked with the University of Washington library in our transfer from the wordpress.com to wordpress.org versions of our website, so we used reclaim hosting their their domain. Reclaim is a great hosting site for most digital humnities projects as it is inexpensive and has fairly ample storage, but there are also many great alternatives.</p>

<p> Once our domain was created, we exported all old content from our website and imported it into our new one. Once our old content was uploaded Kelly gotto work editing and updating pages, creating a new infastructure for the website, and customizing our site. The major work of Wordpress is done in HTML for content creation. The HTML used can range a lot, as many of the things that strictly need to be on the website can be typed directly into the interface using Wordpress's blocks features. Where this is not sufficient is adding more complex kinds of content to the website or if you are hoping to format your work. For example, all of our staff pages were formatted to look similar with similarly sized photos and similar information. This would not have been possible (in this form at least) without coding those features in the HTML or CSS.</p>

<h3>Working With The Text: XML and TEI Tagging</h3>
<h5>Main Uses</h5>
<ul><li>Marking up text</li></ul>
<h5>Required Coding Knowledge</h5>
<ul><li>XML</li>
  <li>TEI</li></ul>

<p>When it came to the transcription and markup of the witnesses themselves, our fabulous XML editors took the lead. Led initially by Caitlin Postal, the team spent time both last and this summer discussing how to make our tagging ethically centered, no small task when working with this text. Putting ethics at the center of our project has been of the utmost importance from the project's inception. The TEI tagging is one aspect of the project that proved difficult given that goal and the constraints of our graduate student workers. </p>
<p>There were two concerns that were central to all of our considertions of tagging in the texts. First, how can we tag our texts with ethical engagement in mind and second, how can we keep ethics central to tagging without creating a system that is not feasible for our team members, particualry our graduate student contributers. These questions have remained important from the beginning of the project.</p>
<p>The first plan was to tag texts with person, location, etc. tags. This system, while not perfect, would allow for the tagging of things like unnamed groups of characters as people. One big consideration was if pronouns or referents needed to be tagged. If adding those elements into the tagging, it almost doubles the workload of the coders. After working with it for much of last summer and part of this summer and not coming to a clear resolution about the most ethical way to tag these witnesses, our team decided to try a new way of tagging. Based on the model for Havelok the Dane (model discussed in detail by Dorthy Kim, see annotated bibliography for citation) we tried person, place, and thing tagging. In this system, every person including pronouns would get a simple person tag, every place a place tag, and every item a thing tag. For some of the more complex questions like animate objects, a combination of tags could be used. For example, a talking rock could be tagged as both person and thing. While this system appeals to us in many ways, it was not feasible within the constraints of our graduate student workers time. Therefore, after trying multiple methods, it was decided that we would continue doing TEI conformant XML tagging to code the structure, formatting, and characteristics of the text as before and leave more complex tagging to phase three.</p>

<h3>The Struggles of Multiple Platforms: Rendering XML with CETEIcean</h3>
<h5>Main Uses</h5>
<ul><li>Render xml without XSLT transformation in the browser</li></ul>
<h5>Required Coding Knowledge</h5>
<ul><li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript highly recommended</li>
  <li>Basic command line knowledge highly recommended</li></ul>

<p> One of the most difficult parts of this project has been rendering the XML that our transcription team works so hard to produce in the browser. This is another place where we felt that ethics should be at the center of our project so, instead of working with expensive, proprietary programs to render the XML we decided to to go another way. We used CETEIcean, an open source XML to HTML5 browser conversion package written by Hugh Cayless and Raffaele Viglianti and openly available on GitHub. In crude terms, CETEIcean works by connecting a Javascript file that contains directions for "translating" XML tags into HTML5 tags, a CSS file that contains formatting and aesthetic information, an XML document containing the marked-up text, and an HTML document used to link them all together. As each of the subsequent documents are linked in the HTML, the text renders in the browser.</p>
<p>As with all digital humanities projects, we encountered some bumps along the way. Specifically, the most difficult part of working with CETEIcean was enabling CORS. CORS, or corss origin reference sharing, is a system that allows one website to take informtion from another and use it in its own platform. For our case, we wanted Wordpress.org to fetch the code that was within our GitHub repository and use it to render the documents on our website. CORS must be enabled for wordpress, though, and because of updates and theme specifics it was extremely difficult to get it to behave. </p>

<h3> Dreaming Big: Other Ideas and Discussion from Summer 2020</h3>
<p>It may be symptomatic of working in the humanities, or maybe even of being academics in general, that we often dream much bigger than we can do. The RCLM was no expection, especially for main web developer Kelly thoughout the summer of 2020. It is meaningful to contextualize the narrative that you read above: we were creating the RCLM thoughout the months in which the US was at the height of the Coronavirus pandemic. As discussed breifly in the XML and TEI section, the majority of RCLM team members are also graduate students with publish or perish weighing heavily on their minds, reading lists to get through, and dissertations to write. Even for those team members who are not graduate students, there are books to complete, tenure portfolios to prepare, semesters to get ready for. Academics know better than anyone that there is ALWAYS something else to do.</p>
<p>Dreaming big is not a bad thing. While many of the projects that we dreamed about did not get completed during the summer of 2020, they arguably made the project better in even its current state because they pushed us to consider what was important to our team, our project, and our purpose.</p>
<p>Some of our big idea projects from this summer included the addition of sound and images to the website, coding a Medieval language Natural Language Processing algorithm, the creation of a textual comparison machine that does not require naming a base text, and writing a fuzzy search algorithm that would allow users of the website to search for TEI tags or across various dialects, spellings, and abbreviations. Some of these projects will get done between now and when the project is finished. Others will not. And that's okay. One of the most important parts of a digital humanities project is to dream big but think reasonably. If there is extra time there is always work to do, but what are the features that are absolutely necessary for the project to succeed? This is the mantra that governed the web development and larger RCLM project throughout 2020.</p>

<h3>What We Learned and Moving Forward</h3>
<h5>Kelly's Reflections</h5>
<p>Reflecting now on my time working on the RCLM project, I have learned to expect the unexpected and that flexibility is key to working with technology when used for DH. As someone with a background in both English literature and computer science, I am used to some minor unexpected hiccups when coding. Anyone who codes frequenctly will tell you that problems and google are two things that can be assured will be a part of every project. What I did not expect was consider the ethics of my code or the problems that arose as deeply as I did. This project gave me a new respect for the consideration that must go into every line of code that you write even when intuitively it seems that a website is neutral. Technology is never neutral, and the website development on this project is a testament to that. One way that we tried to put accessibility first was to always consider the implication of each development choice for different types of screens. We hope that this website will be accessible on computers, tablets, and phones.</p>
<p>More generally, I think that it can be easy to underestimate the time, energy, and expertise that are needed to create Digital Humanities projects. Even for myself, with my ample coding experience, I often think that I will just throw together a website quickly and without much difficulty. If nothing else, this projects has proven that even with efficiency and creating reproducable workflows at the core of our labor practices the creation of digital editions simply takes time. This is not limited to digital editions, either. Rather, all DH projects have the possibility of taking longer than one imagined they ever could. One of the reasons for this is that DH projects are almost always collaborative, meaning that no one person can work in total isolation and is, to at least some degree, at the mercy of others schedules. While this might sound less than ideal, the collaborative aspects of DH projects are what make them interesting, and I hope that the as DH becomes more common the humanities increases collaborative work more generally as well. The most rewarding part of this project for me, as a contemporary Americanist and literary theorist, was to work with Medievalists, Early Modernists, those from different departments and backgrounds, those on another coast, etc. in its creation. This collaboration not only makes the RCLM project incredibly rich, but also enhanced my experience working on the project greatly. If there is one thing that I hope this project proves more than anything else, it is that collaboration, particualry when it comes to questions of ethically engaging with text or technology, is the way forward in the humanities.</p>
