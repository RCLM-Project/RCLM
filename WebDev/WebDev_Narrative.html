<h2> Building a Digital Edition: Under the Hood</h2>
<h4>A Short Guide to the Coding and Web Development of the RCLM Project</h4>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> The creation of a digital edition is not just translation, TEI or XML encoding, or compiling resources, there is also vital work to be done on making sure that the project functions as a digital project. While it might seem like a last step, the coding and website development of a digital project is where authors can control how a text renders, how readers will interact with it, and code in accessibility features that make the project more usable.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The first step of creating any Digital Humanities project is to identify what you need. Often, this is not a what but rather a who. The truth of any digital humanities project is that one person can rarely if ever support an entire project, and when it comes to coding we often do not even know who or what to look for when considering collaborators. This project narrative looks to begin rectifying this issue by exploring some of the features of the site, how they were constructed, and what is required to create something similar.</p>

<h3> A Project Management System: GitHub</h3>
<h5>Main Uses</h5>
<ul><li>Version Control</li>
  <li>Collaborative Workflow</li>
  <li>Safe Data Storage</li>
  <li>Sharing Data and Project Materials Publically</li></ul>
<h5>Required Coding Knowledge</h5>
<ul><li>None if using the Github.com graphical user interface (GUI) online</li>
  <li>None if using the GitHub Desktop App</li>
  <li>If you are looking to do more advanced work with GitHub, you should consider learning shell coding, likely bash or tsch, which is useful for more advanced functions within GitHub</li>
<p> GitHub is a popular version control system. It can be used as a way to track all versions of a document worked on by all team members. While GitHub is typically thought of as a collaborative tool, it can also be used by smaller teams or single people. The advantage of using GitHub over something like Google Docs is that GitHub stores each version individually, meaning that you can access older versions without overwriting newer ones. It also makes it nearly impossible for collaborators to write over each other's work. When two collaborators happen to edit the same portions of a document, GitHub will flag the documents and ask which changes should be kept.</p>
<p>While most associate GitHub with code, GitHub repositories can actually store many types of files. For humanistic projects, GitHub is useful for storing code, sure, but also for text-based documents, media,
