<h4>A Short Guide to the Coding and Web Development of the RCLM Project</h4>
<br>

<br>
<p> The creation of a digital edition is not just translation, TEI or XML encoding, or compiling resources, there is also vital work to be done on making sure that the project functions as a digital project. While it might seem like a last step, the coding and website development of a digital project is where authors can control how a text renders, how readers will interact with it, and code in accessibility features that make the project more usable.</p>
