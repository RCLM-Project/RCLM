This is the repository which stores information for the Richard de Coer Lyon Multitext, directed by Dr. Leila K. Norako at the University of Washington. This born-digital project offers scholars, students, and interested publics the ability to examine all extant manuscript and early print versions of the late Middle English romance, Richard Coer de Lyon. Digital work on this project began in summer 2019 and continues in summer 2020.
