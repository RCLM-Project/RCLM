# RCLM
This is the repository which stores information for the Richard de Coer Lyon Multitext, directed by Dr. Leila K. Norako at the University of Washington.

This born-digital project offers scholars, students, and interested publics the ability to examine all extant manuscript and early print versions of the late Middle English romance, Richard Coer de Lyon. Digital work on this project began in summer 2019 and continues in summer 2020.


Statement on Ethical Use of Repository:

Given that this romance focuses squarely on Richard I of England, given the virulent forms of Islamophobia and racism in which it trafficks, and given the frequency with which crusading history, historical crusaders, and crusading iconography are used by white supremacists and Nazis in our present moment, we—the RCLM team—invite you to pause before entering this website in order to agree to abide by the ethical guidelines and standards of this project:

The RCLM project and team emphatically reject and condemn all forms of Nazism, Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism, homophobia, misogyny, and white-supremacy. We reject the weaponizing of the medieval past in our present. And in response to this weaponization, The RCLM digital project is deliberately and carefully designed at every level (from the TEI markup, to its numerous textual and explanatory notes, to its robust Resources section) to assist scholars, students, and interested publics in ethically confronting and reckoning with this difficult but critically important cultural artifact.

By entering, forking, or utilizing this Repository, you agree to abide by these ethical standards, and to use this project and its materials in ways that do no harm.
