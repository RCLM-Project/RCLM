Statement on Ethical Use of the The Software:
Given that this romance focuses squarely on Richard I of England, given the virulent forms of Islamophobia and racism in which it trafficks, and given the frequency with which crusading history, historical crusaders, and crusading iconography are used by white supremacists and Nazis in our present moment, we—the RCLM team—invite you to pause before entering this website in order to agree to abide by the ethical guidelines and standards of this project:

The RCLM project and team emphatically reject and condemn all forms of Nazism, Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism, homophobia, misogyny, and white-supremacy. We reject the weaponizing of the medieval past in our present. And in response to this weaponization, The RCLM digital project is deliberately and carefully designed at every level (from the TEI markup, to its numerous textual and explanatory notes, to its robust Resources section) to assist scholars, students, and interested publics in ethically confronting and reckoning with this difficult but critically important cultural artifact.

By entering, forking, or utilizing this Repository (i.e. the software), you agree to abide by these ethical standards, and to use this project and its materials in ways that do no harm.
