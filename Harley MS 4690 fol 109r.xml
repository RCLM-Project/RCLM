fol. 109r

<!--LKN text: The version of RCL contained in Harley MS 4690 begins on fol. 109r in the second/right-hand column. The first column and the preceding folio are blank, and this particular witness of RCL begins mid-sentence and midway through the Tournament of Salisbury episode. This particular verse witness is inserted into a prose chronicle (The Prose Brut) to account for this particular part of English history.-->
<!--LKN summ: The Tournament of Salisbury-->

Supplying Larkin’s note here for now since we’ll want to draw on it and Finlayson, who he references: 399 Fouke Doly. Of undoubted historicity, Fulk D’Oilly and Thomas Moulton (line 433) were Lincolnshire knights connected by marriage in the thirteenth century. As they do not appear in chronicles of the Third Crusade, Finalyson suggests that the large role these knights play in RCL’s a version represents an early redactor’s efforts “to glorify his or a patron’s family,” since the names do not occur in L, the fragment that Finlayson believes to contain the story’s basic form (“‘Richard, Coer de Lyon,’” p. 166; and “Legendary Ancestors”) (METS RCL, n. 399)-->
