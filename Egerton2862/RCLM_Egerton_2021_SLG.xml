There, upon the advice of the military orders and local Christians, Richard decided to turn back to the coast, as the army was unable to attack Jerusalem without being harassed or hold the city if captured. Several contingents of crusaders did leave the campaign at this point--something indicated in the poem below--so this episode may reflect a version of those historical negotiations. Other manuscripts of the poem have Richard's forces proceeding directly to Ascalon. -->

The Duke returned to Austria soon after, so he was not present at the historical rebuilding of the walls of Ascalon. During his return from the Third Crusade Richard was captured and imprisoned by Leopold, who eventually passed him to the Emperor Henry VI for ransom, creating a scandal in the Catholic world for the violation of crusaders' legal protections. Here the poem turns that event into a commentary on crusader cooperation across different estates. -->

There are anonymous late fifteenth-century English versions known as Sidrak and Bokkus. Some other manuscripts have "Vrrake" here instead, which has not been identified. -->
Ne of Ely ne of Octauyan <!-- LBM expl: "Ely"=unknown, perhaps an error. Some other manuscripts have "Vrre" here instead, who does feature in Thomas Malory's later Le Morte Darthur, but not in a surviving ME romance.
