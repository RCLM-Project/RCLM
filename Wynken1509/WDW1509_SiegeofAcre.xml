        With moche store of syluer and golde
        With two hondred shyppes I fynde
        Saylynge forwarde with the wynde
        And afterwarde fyfty galyes
        For to warde his nauyes
        And as the doughty kynge Rycharde
        Came saylynge to Acrys warde
        And had sayled with wynde at wyll
        Ten dayes fayre and styll
        The alleuenth daye they sayled in tempest
        That nyght ne daye had they no rest
        And as they were in auenture

        The dromonde was so heuy of fraught

        Alyn quyckly and men I nowe

        With the kynge of fraunce we be saunce fayle
        Frome poyle we brynge this vytayle
        A moneth we haue lyen in the see

        And sayd felowe go do thy best

        For kynge Rycharde and his galyes
        We wyll not gyue two flyes
        The trenchemere began to rowe harde
        Tyll he came to kynge Rycharde
        And swore to hym by saynt Ihone
        It were sarasynes euerychone

        A galey came saylynge behynde
        And smote hym swythe fast
        That the sterne all to brast
        The sarasynes were armed wele
        Both in Iren and in stele
        And stode aborde and fought harde

        Kynge Rycharde and his knyghtes</l>

        Stronge strokes for with harde stones</l>
        Out of the toppe castell on hye</l>
        That neuer was Rycharde his deth so nye</l>

        Tho stode aborde baron and knyght</l>
        To helpe kynge Rycharde for to fyght</l>
        A stronge batayll there began then</l>

        And in the bekerynge that was so harde</l>
        In to the dromonde came kynge Rycharde</l>
        Whan he was therin with grete haste</l>
        He dressed his backe to the maste</l>
        With his axe all that he raught</l>

        Some he hytte on the bassyn </l>

        No more than a knyfe doth the waxe</l>

       The sarasynes as I you tell</l>
       Sayd he was the deuyll of hell</l>
       And ouer borde than lepte they</l>
       And drowned them selfe I you sey</l>
       Syxtene hondred there were quelde</l>

       Of that batayll at Acrys</l>
       Kynge Rycharde founde therin faunce fayle</l>
       Moche store and grete vytayle</l>
       Many barrelles of fyre gregeys</l>

       Of the tresour had he nought the mounde</l>

	Â¶How kynge Rycharde cutte a two a grete

       KYnge Rycharde after anone ryght</l>
       Towarde Acrys gan hym dyght</l>
       And as he sayled towarde surrye</l>
       He was warned of a spye</l>
       How the folke of the hethen lawe</l>
       A grete chayne they had Idrawe</l>
       Ouer the hauen of Acrys fers</l>
       Was fastened to two pyllers</l>
       That no shyppe sholde in wynne</l>
       Ne tho ought that were there in</l>
       Therfore seuen yere and more</l>

       And with hongre suffre payne</l>
       For lettynge of that same chayne</l>
       Whan kynge Rycharde herde that tydynge</l>
       For Ioye his herte began to sprynge</l>
       And swore and sayd in his thought</l>
       All that ne sholde them kepe nought</l>

       A swyfte stronge galey he toke</l>
       Trenchemere so sayth the boke</l>
       And stered the galey ryght euen</l>
       All mydwarde the hauen</l>
       the maryners neuer so wrothe</l>
       He made them rowe and sayle bothe</l>
       The galey yede as swyfte</l>
       As ony foule by the lyfte</l>
       And kynge Rycharde that was so good</l>
       With his axe afore the shyppe stode</l>
       And whan he came to the chayne</l>
       With his axe he smote it atwayne</l>
       That all the barons verament</l>
       Sayd it was a noble dente</l>
       And for Ioye of that dede</l>
       The cuppes faste aboute yede</l>
       With good wyne pyment and clare</l>
       And sayled towarde Acrys cyte</l>
       Kynge Rycharde out of his galye</l>
       Let cast wylde fyre in to the skye</l>
       And the fyrst grekes in to the se</l>
       All on a fyre were the</l>
       His trumppettes yede in his galye</l>
       Men myght it here in to the skye</l>
       Trompettes hornes and shalmyse </l>
       The see brente all of fyre grekes</l>
Gynnes he had of wonder wyse</l>
Mangenelles of grete quyentyse</l>
Arblast bowe made with gynne</l>
The holy londe therwith to wynne</l>
Ouer all other vtterly</l>
He had a myle of grete maystry</l>

In the myddes of a shyppe to stonde</l>
Suche ne sawe they neuer in no londe</l>
Foure sayles were therto all newe</l>
Yelowe and grene rede and blewe</l>
With canuas I layde all aboute</l>
Full costly within and without</l>
And all within full of fyre</l>
Of torches made of wexe clere</l>
Ouerthwarte and endlonge</l>
With spryngelles of fyre they dyde honde</l>
Grounde they neyther corne ne goode</l>
But robbed as they were wood</l>
Out of theyr eyen came rede blode</l>
Before the trough one there stode</l>
That all in blode was begone</l>
Suche another was neuer none</l>
And hornes he had vpon his hede</l>
The sarasynes of hym had grete drede</l>
For the robbynge of the stones</l>
They wende it had ben mennes bones</l> 
For it was within the nyght
They were a grysed of that syght
And sayd he was the deuyll of hell
That was come them to quell
Alytell before the lyght of the daye
Clenly they were done awaye
Kynge Rycharde after the meruayle
Wente quyckly to londe faunce fayle
The kynge of fraunce ayenst hym came
And in his harneys he hym name
Rycharde kylled hym with grete honour
So dyde euery kynge and emperour
 Kynge R. + H.i.

All the kynges of crystente
That had there longe be
And longe had layne in dolour
Undertonde Rycharde with honour
An archebysshop of grete pryse
Dyde kynge Rycharde his seruyce
And syth ledde hym as ye may se
In to a pauylyon of preuyte
And tolde hym there a dolefull tale
Of a shrewde many and fale
Now he sayd kynge Rycharde I here
This syege hath lasted seuen yere
It may not be let for thy
Moche sorowe haue we suffred sykerly
For he had no castell
That vs of ony warde fell
But a wyde dyche and a depe
We made vs within to kepe
With barbycanes for the nones
Aye I wrought with harde stones
Whan the dyche was I made
Salandyn the sowdan was glade
And came on vs with grete route
And beset vs all aboute
And with hym markys feraunt
That lyueth on mahowne and termagaunt
He was a crysten kynge some whyle
He hath done vs more shame & gyle
Than the sowdan and his hoost
The fader and sone and holy goost
Graunte hym grace of worldes shame
Markys feraunt by his name

Our fyrst batayll sekerly
That was stronge and deedly
Well fought our crysten knyghtes
And slewe the sarasynes downryghtes
Our crysten had the maystry
The sarasynes fledde with sory crye
We slewe many of them tho
And they of vs many also
I shall tell you of what case
To many a man it fell alas
As we dyde sarasynes to dede
It befell a noble stede
Out raged fro a paynym
The crysten fast folowed hym
The sarasynes sawe where we came
And fledde asyde all than
And came ayenst vs with stronge fyght
And slewe many a crysten knyght
And there we lost or we wyste
The best bodyes vnder cryste
The erle feres of Englonde
There was neuer doughtyer of honde
And the emperour of almayne
And Ianyn the erle of spayne
Twelue thousande of our meyne
There was slayne with grete pyte
Therof was the sowdan glade
On the morowe a newe sawte he made
And he let take all the cors
Bothe of deed men and of hors
And cast them in to our well
Us to poyson and to quell
 Kynge R. H.ii.

Dyde he neuer a worse dede
To crysten men for no nede
For that poyson and that brethe
Fourty thousande toke theyr dethe
Soone after it was not to hyde
The thyrde case vs gan betyde
A shyppe came saylynge on the see
Charged with whete grete plente
And wylde fyre and armure bryght
To helpe the sarasynes to fyght
Our crysten toke the rede saunce fayle
That they wolde the shyppe assayle
And so we dyde to our domage
The wynde blewe fast with grete rage
The sarasynes drewe vp theyr sayle
And ouersayled vs without fayle
There we lost fourty score
That hath vs greued swythe sore
On saynt Iames euyn verament
The sarasynes out of Acrys went
And pyght pauylyons grete and wynde
For to haue begyled vs that tyde
Our crysten men were wyght
Erle baron squyer and knyght
Sawe the sarasynes had ryches
And we of all good destres
We thought to wyn to our pay
Of that tresour yf that we may
Fyfty thousande them armed wele
Bothe in Iron and in stele
And wente forth to batayllynge
The sarasynes sawe theyr comynge

And fledde asyde swythe faste
And our meyne came after in haste
And gan ryde with grete randon
Tyll they came to theyr pauylyon
They founde there felowe rede
Tho we wende they fledde for drede
We founde therin brede and wyne
Golde and syluer and bawdekyne
Uessell of syluer and ouppes of golde
More than we take wolde
Some stode some sate downe
And ete and dranke grete foysowne
After mete pauylyons newe
Were with swerdes all to hewe
And charged horses with vytayle
As nyse men sholde without fayle
Golde and syluer they put in males
And bounde them faste with gyrdelles
Whan eche man had his charge
Home ehey wente with spere and targe
The sarasynes sawe theyr wendynge
And came after faste slyngynge
At shorte wordes a grete route
Had beset vs all aboute
Soone the male were downe caste
Ayenst the sarasynes they fought faste
There we loste thousandes fyftene
Noble men hardy and kene
This greued vs ryght sore
For we wende all to be lore
But god almyghty heuen kynge
He sente vs soone socourynge
 Kynge R. + H.iii.

The doughty erle of champayne
And good knyghtes of brytayne
And randulfe the gamyles
Iohan neuell and his brother myles
And Bawdewyne a clerke full mery
The archebysshop of Caunterbury
And with them came his neuewe
A noble baron of grete vertewe
Roberte gaunter of englonde
Ayenst the sarasynes fore to stonde
And many knyghtes of hongery
And other noble cheuallery
Than helde we a grete batayle
But a harde case befell vs without fayle
At myghelmasse it must be tolde
The weder begau to wexe colde
Tho fell bothe rayne and hayle
And snowe fyue fote witdout fayle
Thonder lyghtnynge & weder toughe
For honger therwith our men it sloughe
For honger we lost and colde wyndes
Of our folke thre score thousandes
Than we our good hors slowe
Soden and eten the guttes towe
The flesshe was deled for grete deynte
Therof had no man plente
But we ete it without brede
To peces we carued the hede
In water we boyled the blode
That vs thought mete full gode
A quarter of whete men vs solde
For thre pounde of flouraunce tolde

For fourty pounde men solde an axe
Though it were but lytell I waxe
A swyne for an hondred floryne
A gose for halfe a marke of golde fyne
And for an henne to syke thynges
Men gaue fyue shelynges
And for an egge pens alleuen
And for a pere syxe or seuen
For an appell men gaue pens syxe
And thus our folke vnblythe wyxe
And dyed for honger and for wo
The ryche men toke to rede tho
A ryche dole for to dyght
To barons and to many a poore knyght
Twelue pens men eueryche
And syxe to poore that were not ryche
And four to euery small wyght
Thus the ryche the poore dyght
Therwith the more and the lasse
Bought them flesshe of horse and asse
They myght none other thynge gete
They thought it full good mete
I haue the tolde kynge Rycharde here
Of our folke theyr lere
And domage of Acrys hoost
But blessyd be the holy goost
And Mary that bare Ihesus
That thou arte amonge vs
Thorugh thy helpe I hope well

How kynge Rycharde wan the cyte of Acrys.
 Kynge R. + H.iiii.

KYnge Rycharde wepte wt his eyen bothe
And syth sayd he thus forsothe
Syr bysshop I beseche you praye for vs
That vs might sende swete Ihesus
His fone all for to dystroye
That they no more vs anoye
Thus Rycharde toke loue & keped his stede
And prycked out that felowrede
He rode aboute the close dyche
Towarde Acrys sykerlyche
Tyll he came co the hospytale
Of saynt Iohan as I tell by tale
There he let pytche his pauylyon
And let arere vp his matgryffon
That was a tree castell fyne
To gyue assawte to many a sarasyne

That he myght in to Acrys sene
He had .xiii. shyppes full of bene
Whan the castell was framed well
He lette therin a mangenell
He comaunded his men blyue
To fetche vp been hyue
And byd taberrars & trompettes blowe
To sawte the cyte on a throw
Kynge Rycharde in Acyrs cyte
Let cast the hyues grete plente
The wheder was hote in somer tyde
The beest brake out on euery syde
They were agreued full of grame
And dyde the sarasynes moche shame
For they stynged them in the vysage
That they began for to rage
And hydde them in a depe sellere
For they durste not come them nere
They sawe kynge Rycharde was full fell
Whan his flyen bytte so well
Another vp Rycharde gan set
That was cleped Robynet
A stronge gynne for the nones
That cast in to Acrys grete stones
The kynge Rycharde the conquerour
Cleped to hym anone his mynour
And them mynde in to the toure
That is cleped mawndytcoloure
He sware his othe by his crowne
But it were brought downe
By none the vttermest wall
He sholde be hewen in peces small
 Kynge R. + J.i.

The mynours myned faste
And gonners bente and stones caste
Tho syrasynes began to arme them all
And ranne in hasst vnto the wall
In whyte shetes they gan them wrythen
For bytynge of kynge Rychardes flyen
They sayd this man doth vs grete payne
For he doth bothe throwe and mayne
We sawe neuer kynge thus begynne
It is grete doute leste he vs wynne
Kynge Rycharde stode in his matgryffowne
And sawe there dedes in the towne
Whederwarde the sarasynes drewe
And arowes englysshe to them slewe
Out of arblastes arowes smerte
Thorugh lunge leuer arme & herte
The frensshe men with grete noblay
Helped to myne full well that daye
The vttermest wall that daye was downe cast
And many sarasynes slayue at last
That daye Rycharde so well spedde thore
That he was holden for a conquerore
For better he spedde that daye or none
Than all the other in seuen yere had done
The sarasynes myght not endoure
They fledde in to that hye toure
They lyght torches aboute the wall
Men myght se it ouer all
The torches caste grete lyght
That betokened a newe fyght
That was come fro Englonde
There thorugh they myght not stonde</l>

But yf Salandyn the sowdan
Came to them with men anone
Salandyn was ten myle then
And sawe the torches lyght bren
He let gader his folke togyder
As thycke as snowe falleth in wynter
They assembled vpon a playne
Besyde Acrys vpon a mountayne
Syxty thousande men I fynde
Cockes of heye he made them bynde
To go before hastelyche
To fyll the crysten dyche
To rescowe Acrys they haue rede
And to do the crysten men to dede
After came barons and knyghtes
Stronge in armes stoute in fyghtes
By order they came in theyr manere
Of rede sendell was theyr banere
With thre gryffons depaynted well
And of asure a fayre bendell
Soone after there came as many mo
Barons rydynge and knyghtes also
Theyr gomfanon and theyr pensell
Was wrought of good sendell
As he faught with a lyon
And in surrey with a dragon
The fyrst were rede and grene
Than came the thyrde by dene
With syxty thousande knyghtes
In ynde I armed to all ryghtes
After came whyte as ony snowe
Fyfty thousande on a rowe
 Kynge R. + J.ii.

There amonge was Salandyn
And his neuewe myrry molendyn
Theyr baners whyte without fable
With thre sarasynes hedes of sable
That were shapen noble and large
Of balyn bothe shelde and targe
No man coude tell the route
They beset the crysten aboute
The fote men cast theyr cothes of heye
To make the hors men redy weye
And fylled the dyche full vpryght
That all the hoost well entred myght
The sarasynes had entred nye
But god almyghty therto sye
The crye arose thorugh the crysten hoost
Soyes seygnyours for the holy goost
But we haue the better socoure
We be foriorne by saynt sauyoure
There ye myght se many a wyght man
That quyckly to his armure ran
And wente anone in to the dyche
And defended it hastelyche
There was many a gentyll hewed
Quykly from the body take the hewed
Sheldes fell clouen a two
And many a stede stycked also
Many a knyght lost his harnes
And many a stede drewe theyr tharnes
And many a doughty man saunce fayle
Was slayne in that batayle
But Rycharde our kynge was seke tho
All crystendome to moche wo

He myght not his body stere
Though his pauylyon had ben in fyre
Therfore the kynge of fraunce made a crye
Amonge the crysten company
That they ne sholde for dethes doute
Not passe theyr close dyche aboute
But holde them all within
That the sarasynes sholde them not wyn
And tho that were in I come
Of sarasynes they were I nome
And hastely done to dede
For them yede no raunson to mede
Whyle kynge Rycharde so syke lay
The reason I you tell may
For the trauayll of the se
And stronge ayre of that countre
And for vnkynde stynke and hete
And mete and drynke was not swete
To his body that he there fonde
As it was in englonde
Kynge Rycharde his men bad seche
Forsome wyse clerke and certayne leche
Crysten or elles sarasyne
For to loke his bryne
And eueryche sayd his aduyse
But there was none of them wyse
That myght his sorowe sese
Or of his payne hym relese
Sory was the folke englysshe
For theyr lorde laye in grete anguysshe
For kynge Rycharde laye so sore syke
All about they gan seke
 Kynge R. + J.iii.

On knees prayed the crysten hoost
To the fader and sone and holy goost
Nyght and daye with good entent
That Rycharde myght haue amendement
Thorugh the byddynge of our lady dere
Her blessyd sone herde her prayere
Thorugh his grace and vertue
He tourned out of his ague
To mete had he no sauour
To wyne ne water ne to no lycour
But after porke he was a longed
Though all his men sholde be honged
They ne myght in that countree
Neyther for golde nor for fee
No porke fynde take ne gete
That kynge Rycharde myght ete
A noble knyght was with our kynge
Whan he wyst of that tydynge
That Rychardes maners were syche
To the stewarde he sayd pryuelyche
Our lorde lyeth sore seke Iwys
After porke he alonged is
And ye ne may none fynde to sell
No man be so hardy to tell
And yf he do he may dye
Ye must as I you saye
That he knowe not of that
Take a sarasyne yonge and fat
And in haste that deed be slawe
And his heed of hym be fawe
And soden full hastely
With good pouder and spycery

And with good saffron of good colour
Whan kynge Rycharde feleth the sauour
Out of the ague yf he be wente
He shall haue therto good talente
Whan he hath therof a taste
And eten a good repaste
And supped of the brothe a sope
And slepe therafter and swete a drope
Thorugh goddes helpe and my counsayle
Soone he shall be hole without fayle
The sothe to saye at wordes fewe
Slayne and soden was that shrewe
Before Rycharde it was brought
Quod his folke we haue porke sought
Aryse and suppe of the brothe sote
Thorugh goddes myght it shall be bote
Before the kynge kerued a knyght
He ete faster than he kerue myght
Kynge Rycharde knewe the flesshe fro Ã¾ bones
And dranke ryght well after for the nones
nd whan he had eten I nowe
He laye styll and drewe in his arme
His chamberlayne couered hym warme
He laye and slepte and swette a stounde
Soone he became hole and sounde
Whan he awake he arose
And romed aboute in the close
And all the folke hym shewed
Glad was bothe lerned and lewed
And thanked Ihesu and Mary
That he was out of his malady
 Kynge R. + J.iiii.

The sarasynes spedde with all theyr myght
The dyche to wynne with all theyr myght
The barbycanes they felde downe
And had nyght entred and in I come
Whan kynge Rycharde that tydynges herde
As a wdde man tho he sterte ferde
And he armed hym in his armour
For loue of cryst our sauyour
To fyght I haue grete delyte
With houndes that wylleth vs despyte
Now I me fele hole and lyght
This daye shall I preue my myght
Yf I am stronge as I was before
And yf I can dele strokes grete store
All that I mete I shall fele
Suche a dole I shall them dele
That for the loue of theyr mahon
They shall haue theyr waryson
He was armed to all ryghtes
With hym his fote men squyers & knyghtes
And the crysten all by dene
Wonder it was that hoost to sene
The sothe to saye and not to lye
Of sarasynes were twyes so manye
Before wente his templers
His gascoynes and his ospytalers
Our kynge amonge the sarsynes rode
To some he gaue full grete lode
A kynge he hyt aboue the shelde
That helme & heede flowe in the felde
Another he hath a stroke I raught
All his harneys halpe hym naught

To the sadyll he clefte the ferth
All that he smote it wente to erth
Blythe was the crysten felawrede
Of kynge Rycharde and of his dede
For none armure withstode his axe
No more than a knyfe doth the waxe
Whan the sowdan sawe them so stronge
He sayd the deuyll was them amonge
For downe ryght there he slewe
With all his hoost he hym withdrewe
And fledde with all his baronage
In to towne men call it cage
And certes all the rerewarde
Were slayne by kynge Rycharde
The sarasynes that in Acrys ware
Were anoyed and full of care
Whan they sawe the sowdan flee
And kynge Rycharde downe ryght slee
Thus all daye tyll it was nyght
They and the crysten kepte fyght
At euen whan the sonne was set
Euery man drewe to his reset
The crysten bothe poore and ryche
Wente within theyr close dyche
To reste them for they were wery
And kynge Rycharde let make a crye
Trusty folke that myght the pales kepe
Whyle that other lye and slepe
The sarasynes that were withoute
Of kynge Rycharde they had grete doute
For he had the pryse I wonne
Awaye they rode and swythe ronne

That myght flee and them hyde
There they durste not abyde
Of the space of ten englysshe myle
Whan Rycharde had rested a whyle
A knyght his harneys gan vnlace
Hym to comforte and to solace
Hym was brought a soppe in wyne
The heed of the wylde swyne
He sayd fayne I wolde I had
For I am feble feynt and mad
Of myn euyll I am fere
Therwith serue me at my soupere
Quod the coke the heed I ne haue
Than sayd Rycharde so god me saue
But I se the heed of the swyne
Forsoth thou shalte soone lese thyne
The coke sawe none other myght be
He fet the heed and let hym se
He fell on knees and made a crye
Lo the heed here Rycharde mercy
The blacke vysage whan Rycharde sawe
His blacke berde his tethe whyte as snawe
He began to laugh as he were wood
What is sarsynes flesshe so good
And neuer before I it wyste
By goddes deth and his vpryste
Shall we neuer dye for defaute
Whyle we may in assawte
Slee sarasynes and the flesshe take
Wesshe sethe them and bake
Gnawe the flesshe fro the bones
Now I haue assayed them ones

For honger or we be to woo
I and my folke shall ete moo
On the morowe without fayle
The cyte he began to assayle
The sarasynes myght not endoure
They fledde in to the hye toure
And cryed trews and plement
To kynge Rycharde that was so gent
And also to the kynge of fraunce
And bad mercy without dystaunce
Anone stode vp syr latemere
And cryed lowde with voyce clere
He sayd here good lordynges
For I you brynge good tydynges
That syr Salandyn sente by me
He wolde that Acrys yelded be
And Iherusalem in to your honde
And surrey all the londe
To flomiordan the water clere
For two thousande besauntes by yere
And yf ye wyll not so nore
Ye shall haue peas for euermore
So that ye make the kynge of surrye
Markys feraunt of grete maystrye
For he is the strongest man Iwys
Of crystendome or of hethenys
