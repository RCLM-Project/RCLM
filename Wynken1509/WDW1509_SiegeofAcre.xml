	¶How kynge Rycharde cutte a two a grete

       Towarde Acrys gan hym dyght</l>
       And as he sayled towarde surrye</l>
       He was warned of a spye</l>

       A grete chayne they had Idrawe</l>
       Ouer the hauen of Acrys fers</l>

       For lettynge of that same chayne</l>
       Whan kynge Rycharde herde that tydynge</l>
       For Ioye his herte began to sprynge</l>
       And swore and sayd in his thought</l>

       As ony foule by the lyfte</l>
       And kynge Rycharde that was so good</l>
       With his axe afore the shyppe stode</l>
       And whan he came to the chayne</l>
       With his axe he smote it atwayne</l>
       That all the barons verament</l>
       Sayd it was a noble dente</l>
       And for Ioye of that dede</l>
       The cuppes faste aboute yede</l>
       With good wyne pyment and clare</l>

Mangenelles of grete quyentyse</l>
Arblast bowe made with gynne</l>
The holy londe therwith to wynne</l>
Ouer all other vtterly</l>
He had a myle of grete maystry</l>

In the myddes of a shyppe to stonde</l>
Suche ne sawe they neuer in no londe</l>
Foure sayles were therto all newe</l>
Yelowe and grene rede and blewe</l>
With canuas I layde all aboute</l>
Full costly within and without</l>
And all within full of fyre</l>
Of torches made of wexe clere</l>
Ouerthwarte and endlonge</l>
With spryngelles of fyre they dyde honde</l>
Grounde they neyther corne ne goode</l>
But robbed as they were wood</l>
Out of theyr eyen came rede blode</l>
Before the trough one there stode</l>

And hornes he had vpon his hede</l>
The sarasynes of hym had grete drede</l>
For the robbynge of the stones</l>
They wende it had ben mennes bones</l> 
For it was within the nyght</l>
They were a grysed of that syght</l>
And sayd he was the deuyll of hell</l>
That was come them to quell</l>
Alytell before the lyght of the daye</l>
Clenly they were done awaye</l>
Kynge Rycharde after the meruayle</l>
Wente quyckly to londe faunce fayle</l>
The kynge of fraunce ayenst hym came</l>
And in his harneys he hym name</l>

And syth ledde hym as ye may se</l>

And tolde hym there a dolefull tale</l>
Of a shrewde many and fale</l>
Now he sayd kynge Rycharde I here</l>
This syege hath lasted seuen yere</l>

Moche sorowe haue we suffred sykerly</l>
For he had no castell</l>

But a wyde dyche and a depe</l>
We made vs within to kepe</l>
With barbycanes for the nones</l>
Aye I wrought with harde stones</l>

Well fought our crysten knyghtes</l>
And slewe the sarasynes downryghtes</l>
Our crysten had the maystry</l>
The sarasynes fledde with sory crye</l>
We slewe many of them tho</l>

I shall tell you of what case</l>
To many a man it fell alas</l>
As we dyde sarasynes to dede</l>

The crysten fast folowed hym</l>

And slewe many a crysten knyght</l>
And there we lost or we wyste</l>

There was neuer doughtyer of honde</l>
And the emperour of almayne</l>
And Ianyn the erle of spayne</l>
Twelue thousande of our meyne</l>
There was slayne with grete pyte</l>
Therof was the sowdan glade</l>
On the morowe a newe sawte he made</l>
And he let take all the cors</l>
Bothe of deed men and of hors</l>
And cast them in to our well</l>

 Kynge R. + H.iiii.

KYnge Rycharde wepte <choice><abbr>wt</abbr><expan>with</expan></choice> his eyen bothe
And syth sayd he thus forsothe</l>
Syr bysshop I beseche you praye for vs</l>
That vs might sende swete Ihesus
His fone all for to dystroye
That they no more vs anoye
Thus Rycharde toke loue & keped his stede
And prycked out that felowrede
He rode aboute the close dyche
Towarde Acrys sykerlyche
Tyll he came co the hospytale
Of saynt Iohan as I tell by tale
There he let pytche his pauylyon
And let arere vp his matgryffon
That was a tree castell fyne
To gyue assawte to many a sarasyne

That he myght in to Acrys sene
He had .xiii. shyppes full of bene
Whan the castell was framed well
He lette therin a mangenell
He comaunded his men blyue
To fetche vp been hyue
And byd taberrars & trompettes blowe
To sawte the cyte on a throw
Kynge Rycharde in Acyrs cyte
Let cast the hyues grete plente
The wheder was hote in somer tyde
The beest brake out on euery syde
They were agreued full of grame
And dyde the sarasynes moche shame
For they stynged them in the vysage
That they began for to rage
And hydde them in a depe sellere
For they durste not come them nere
They sawe kynge Rycharde was full fell
Whan his flyen bytte so well
Another vp Rycharde gan set
That was cleped Robynet
A stronge gynne for the nones
That cast in to Acrys grete stones
The kynge Rycharde the conquerour
Cleped to hym anone his mynour
And them mynde in to the toure
That is cleped mawndytcoloure
He sware his othe by his crowne
But it were brought downe
By none the vttermest wall
He sholde be hewen in peces small
 Kynge R. + J.i.

The mynours myned faste
And gonners bente and stones caste
Tho syrasynes began to arme them all
And ranne in hasst vnto the wall
In whyte shetes they gan them wrythen
For bytynge of kynge Rychardes flyen
They sayd this man doth vs grete payne
For he doth bothe throwe and mayne
We sawe neuer kynge thus begynne
It is grete doute leste he vs wynne
Kynge Rycharde stode in his matgryffowne
And sawe there dedes in the towne
Whederwarde the sarasynes drewe
And arowes englysshe to them slewe
Out of arblastes arowes smerte
Thorugh lunge leuer arme & herte
The frensshe men with grete noblay
Helped to myne full well that daye
The vttermest wall that daye was downe cast
And many sarasynes slayue at last
That daye Rycharde so well spedde thore
That he was holden for a conquerore
For better he spedde that daye or none
Than all the other in seuen yere had done
The sarasynes myght not endoure
They fledde in to that hye toure
They lyght torches aboute the wall
Men myght se it ouer all
The torches caste grete lyght
That betokened a newe fyght
That was come fro Englonde
There thorugh they myght not stonde</l>

But yf Salandyn the sowdan
Came to them with men anone
Salandyn was ten myle then
And sawe the torches lyght bren
He let gader his folke togyder
As thycke as snowe falleth in wynter
They assembled vpon a playne
Besyde Acrys vpon a mountayne
Syxty thousande men I fynde
Cockes of heye he made them bynde
To go before hastelyche
To fyll the crysten dyche
To rescowe Acrys they haue rede
And to do the crysten men to dede
After came barons and knyghtes
Stronge in armes stoute in fyghtes
By order they came in theyr manere
Of rede sendell was theyr banere
With thre gryffons depaynted well
And of asure a fayre bendell
Soone after there came as many mo
Barons rydynge and knyghtes also
Theyr gomfanon and theyr pensell
Was wrought of good sendell
As he faught with a lyon
And in surrey with a dragon
The fyrst were rede and grene
Than came the thyrde by dene
With syxty thousande knyghtes
In ynde I armed to all ryghtes
After came whyte as ony snowe
Fyfty thousande on a rowe
 Kynge R. + J.ii.

There amonge was Salandyn
And his neuewe myrry molendyn
Theyr baners whyte without fable
With thre sarasynes hedes of sable
That were shapen noble and large
Of balyn bothe shelde and targe
No man coude tell the route
They beset the crysten aboute
The fote men cast theyr cothes of heye
To make the hors men redy weye
And fylled the dyche full vpryght
That all the hoost well entred myght
The sarasynes had entred nye
But god almyghty therto sye
The crye arose thorugh the crysten hoost
Soyes seygnyours for the holy goost
But we haue the better socoure
We be foriorne by saynt sauyoure
There ye myght se many a wyght man
That quyckly to his armure ran
And wente anone in to the dyche
And defended it hastelyche
There was many a gentyll hewed
Quykly from the body take the hewed
Sheldes fell clouen a two
And many a stede stycked also
Many a knyght lost his harnes
And many a stede drewe theyr tharnes
And many a doughty man saunce fayle
Was slayne in that batayle
But Rycharde our kynge was seke tho
All crystendome to moche wo

He myght not his body stere
Though his pauylyon had ben in fyre
Therfore the kynge of fraunce made a crye
Amonge the crysten company
That they ne sholde for dethes doute
Not passe theyr close dyche aboute
But holde them all within
That the sarasynes sholde them not wyn
And tho that were in I come
Of sarasynes they were I nome
And hastely done to dede
For them yede no raunson to mede
Whyle kynge Rycharde so syke lay
The reason I you tell may
For the trauayll of the se
And stronge ayre of that countre
And for vnkynde stynke and hete
And mete and drynke was not swete
To his body that he there fonde
As it was in englonde
Kynge Rycharde his men bad seche
Forsome wyse clerke and certayne leche
Crysten or elles sarasyne
For to loke his bryne
And eueryche sayd his aduyse
But there was none of them wyse
That myght his sorowe sese
Or of his payne hym relese
Sory was the folke englysshe
For theyr lorde laye in grete anguysshe
For kynge Rycharde laye so sore syke
All about they gan seke
 Kynge R. + J.iii.

On knees prayed the crysten hoost
To the fader and sone and holy goost
Nyght and daye with good entent
That Rycharde myght haue amendement
Thorugh the byddynge of our lady dere
Her blessyd sone herde her prayere
Thorugh his grace and vertue
He tourned out of his ague
To mete had he no sauour
To wyne ne water ne to no lycour
But after porke he was a longed
Though all his men sholde be honged
They ne myght in that countree
Neyther for golde nor for fee
No porke fynde take ne gete
That kynge Rycharde myght ete
A noble knyght was with our kynge
Whan he wyst of that tydynge
That Rychardes maners were syche
To the stewarde he sayd pryuelyche
Our lorde lyeth sore seke Iwys
After porke he alonged is
And ye ne may none fynde to sell
No man be so hardy to tell
And yf he do he may dye
Ye must as I you saye
That he knowe not of that
Take a sarasyne yonge and fat
And in haste that deed be slawe
And his heed of hym be fawe
And soden full hastely
With good pouder and spycery

And with good saffron of good colour
Whan kynge Rycharde feleth the sauour
Out of the ague yf he be wente
He shall haue therto good talente
Whan he hath therof a taste
And eten a good repaste
And supped of the brothe a sope
And slepe therafter and swete a drope
Thorugh goddes helpe and my counsayle
Soone he shall be hole without fayle
The sothe to saye at wordes fewe
Slayne and soden was that shrewe
Before Rycharde it was brought
Quod his folke we haue porke sought
Aryse and suppe of the brothe sote
Thorugh goddes myght it shall be bote
