On knees prayed the crysten hoost
To the fader and sone and holy goost
Nyght and daye with good entent
That Rycharde myght haue amendement
Thorugh the byddynge of our lady dere
Her blessyd sone herde her prayere
Thorugh his grace and vertue
He tourned out of his ague
To mete had he no sauour
To wyne ne water ne to no lycour
But after porke he was a longed
Though all his men sholde be honged
They ne myght in that countree
Neyther for golde nor for fee
No porke fynde take ne gete
That kynge Rycharde myght ete
A noble knyght was with our kynge <!--SLG note to refer to Shokoofeh's piece and resources section (first anthropophagy episode)-->
Whan he wyst of that tydynge
That Rychardes maners were syche
To the stewarde he sayd pryuelyche
Our lorde lyeth sore seke Iwys
After porke he alonged is
And ye ne may none fynde to sell
No man be so hardy to tell
And yf he do he may dye
Ye must as I you saye
That he knowe not of that
Take a sarasyne yonge and fat
And in haste that deed be slawe
And his heed of hym be fawe
And soden full hastely
With good pouder and spycery

352jpg, l. 3068

And with good saffron of good colour
Whan kynge Rycharde feleth the sauour
Out of the ague yf he be wente
He shall haue therto good talente
Whan he hath therof a taste
And eten a good repaste
And supped of the brothe a sope
And slepe therafter and swete a drope
Thorugh goddes helpe and my counsayle
Soone he shall be hole without fayle
The sothe to saye at wordes fewe
Slayne and soden was that shrewe
Before Rycharde it was brought
Quod his folke we haue porke sought
Aryse and suppe of the brothe sote
Thorugh goddes myght it shall be bote
Before the kynge kerued a knyght
He ete faster than he kerue myght
Kynge Rycharde knewe the flesshe fro Ã¾[e] bones
And dranke ryght well after for the nones
And whan he had eten I nowe
He laye styll and drewe in his arme
His chamberlayne couered hym warme
He laye and slepte and swette a stounde
Soone he became hole and sounde
Whan he awake he arose
And romed aboute in the close
And all the folke hym shewed
Glad was bothe lerned and lewed
And thanked Ihesu and Mary
That he was out of his malady

The sarasynes spedde with all theyr myght
The dyche to wynne with all theyr myght
The barbycanes they felde downe
And had nyght entred and in I come
Whan kynge Rycharde that tydynges herde
As a wdde man tho he sterte ferde  <note type="text" resp="#CMP">There is a high certainty that "wdde" was meant to be written as "wode."</note>
And he armed hym in his armour
For loue of cryst our sauyour
To fyght I haue grete delyte
With houndes that wylleth vs despyte
Now I me fele hole and lyght
This daye shall I preue my myght
Yf I am stronge as I was before
And yf I can dele strokes grete store
All that I mete I shall fele
Suche a dole I shall them dele
That for the loue of theyr mahon
They shall haue theyr waryson
He was armed to all ryghtes
With hym his fote men squyers & knyghtes
And the crysten all by dene
Wonder it was that hoost to sene
The sothe to saye and not to lye
Of sarasynes were twyes so manye
Before wente his templers
His gascoynes and his ospytalers
Our kynge amonge the sarsynes rode
To some he gaue full grete lode
A kynge he hyt aboue the shelde
That helme & heede flowe in the felde
Another he hath a stroke I raught
All his harneys halpe hym naught

To the sadyll he clefte the ferth
All that he smote it wente to erth
Blythe was the crysten felawrede
Of kynge Rycharde and of his dede
For none armure withstode his axe
No more than a knyfe doth the waxe
Whan the sowdan sawe them so stronge
He sayd the deuyll was them amonge
For downe ryght there he slewe
With all his hoost he hym withdrewe
And fledde with all his baronage
In to towne men call it cage
And certes all the rerewarde
Were slayne by kynge Rycharde
The sarasynes that in Acrys ware
Were anoyed and full of care
Whan they sawe the sowdan flee
And kynge Rycharde downe ryght slee
Thus all daye tyll it was nyght
They and the crysten kepte fyght
At euen whan the sonne was set
Euery man drewe to his reset
The crysten bothe poore and ryche
Wente within theyr close dyche
To reste them for they were wery
And kynge Rycharde let make a crye
Trusty folke that myght the pales kepe
Whyle that other lye and slepe
The sarasynes that were withoute
Of kynge Rycharde they had grete doute
For he had the pryse I wonne
Awaye they rode and swythe ronne

That myght flee and them hyde
There they durste not abyde
Of the space of ten englysshe myle
Whan Rycharde had rested a whyle
A knyght his harneys gan vnlace
Hym to comforte and to solace
Hym was brought a soppe in wyne
The heed of the wylde swyne
He sayd fayne I wolde I had <!--SLG note here to refer to Shokoofeh's piece and resources section (second anthropophagy episode)-->
For I am feble feynt and mad
Of myn euyll I am fere
Therwith serue me at my soupere
Quod the coke the heed I ne haue
Than sayd Rycharde so god me saue
But I se the heed of the swyne
Forsoth thou shalte soone lese thyne

He fet the heed and let hym se
He fell on knees and made a crye
Lo the heed here Rycharde mercy
The blacke vysage whan Rycharde sawe

He began to laugh as he were wood
What is sarsynes flesshe so good
And neuer before I it wyste
By goddes deth and his vpryste
Shall we neuer dye for defaute
Whyle we may in assawte
Slee sarasynes and the flesshe take
Wesshe sethe them and bake
Gnawe the flesshe fro the bones
Now I haue assayed them ones

For honger or we be to woo

They fledde in to the hye toure
And cryed trews and plement <note type="text" resp="#CMP">While there is no visual mark indicating a contraction, it is likely that "plement" is meant to be extended to "parlement".</note>

That traytour shall it neuer be
He was crysten by my faders dayes
And syth he hath renyed his layes
And is become a sarasyne
God gyue hym well euyll pyne

And we beseche you for the loue of god
That ye wyll take your bode
That ye the tresour more and lasse

In my halfe I graunte that forwarde

For all his dogges in hostage
Or they shall dye on euyll rage
And yf I may haue a fewe yere
Of all the londes that ye reken here
I shall not leue halfe a fote

Of all the londes vnder heuen ahawe
And but I haue the rode to morowe
His men shall dye with sorowe
They answered at the forme
They wyste not where it was become
Quod kynge Rycharde syth it is so

Your sowdan is not so slye
So queyntly to blere myn eye

And layde on as they were wode
Tyll valeys ranne all on blode

That the crysten fared as lyons
And that Rycharde with theyr folke fares
As hende grehoundes do with hares
Upon theyr stedes tho they lepte
Swardes and speres to them they grepte
Many a man there slee other
And many a sarasyne his brother
And many of the hethen houndes

Brayne and blode he shedde I nowe
Many an hors his guttes drowe
There was many an emty sadell
It bewepte the chylde in the cradell
He thought to rescower Iakes denayne
But or he came he was slayne
For he and his sones anone
Were all to frusshe flesshe and bone
Yet had he them to his pauylyowne
In despyte of theyr god mahowne
Tho fought Rycharde on euery syde

How he came with his gynnes to batayllynge

And sate vpon his good stede fauele
Well hym loued baron and knyght
For he coude well ordayne a fyght

And he bad them go out in goddes name

In the worlde there ne were
Better knyghtes than they were
Forth they prycked full hardyly
With knyghtes thousandes twenty
And they sarasynes soone they mette
With grymly launces they them grette

To slee the sarasynes he dyde his myght

There myght no knyght come hym to
For no thynge that they myght do
Neyther he myght not withdrawe
For the people of the hethen lawe
It was scathe by Ihesu cryste
That kynge Rycharde therof not wyste
For he was yet all behynde
For to ordeyne twenty thousande
Tho sholde the duke of burgoyne

Thus they came and dyde theyr deuere
Ayenst the hethen pantenere
And Iakes and his sones two
Almoost were slayne tho
They layde on euery syde ryght
And slewe the sarasynes with myght
Twenty Iakes slewe & eyther of his sones ten
Of the crewell hethen men
Ten syth his hors was felde
And euer he couered hym with his shelde
He had no helpe of his templers
Nor of none of his hospytalers

Well he layde on with sworde
And euer he cryed Ihesu lorde

And all to brake hors and man

He lefte his pauylyon and his tent
And fledde awaye verament
Than kynge Rycharde sawe hym fleande
He sewed after faste flyngande
To slee the sowdan he had thought
And for he myght ouertake hym nought
And of a foteman a bowe he toke
And drewe it vp to the hoke
And shotte it to the sowdan anone
And smote hym thorugh the shulder bone
Thus the sowdan with doloure
Fledde frome the batayll of arsure

And of crysten but ten score
Blessyd be Ihesu cryste therfore

But foure hondred or fyue
They were soone brought of out lyue
They lepte on theyr destreres
And at the gate set porters
Kynge Rycharde lepte on fauell
Well armed in yren and in stele
And rode hym out at the gate
The kynge of egypte he mette therate
With syxty thousande of sarasynes fers
With armes bryght and brode baners
Rycharde a duke on the helme hytte
Downe to the grounde he hym slytte
Another he smote on the yren hode
That at his breste his swerde stode
His templers and his barons
Fared ryght lyke wood lyons
And slewe the sarasynes swythe
As grasse falleth before the sythe
The sarasynes sawe no better wone
But fledde awaye euerychone
To Salandynes grete hoost
That fyftene myle laye in coost
Syxty thousande as I you saye
The sowdan loste that same daye
For theyr armure fared as waxe
Ayenst kynge Rychardes axe
Many a sarasyne & hygh lordynge
Yelded them to Rycharde our kynge
Rycharde put them in hostage tho
There were a thousande prysoners & mo
The chase lasted swythe longe
Tyll the tyme of euensonge

Rycharde rode after tyll it was nyght
So many of them to deth he dyght
That no nombre it may accounte
How many of them it wolde amounte
Rycharde lefte without the towne
And pyght there his pauylyowne
And that nyght with mylde herte
He comforted his barones smarte
And ye shall here on the morowe
How there was a daye of sorowe
For the gretest batayll I vnderstonde
That neuer was in ony londe
And ye that this batayll wyll lere
Herken now and ye shall here
As kynge Rycharde sate at his soupere
And gladded his barons with mylde chere
And comforted them with ale and wyne
Two messengers came frome Salandyn
And stode kynge Rycharde before
With longe berdes and with hore
Of two mules they were a lyght
In golde and sylke they were I dyght
Eyther helde other by the honde
And sayd kynge Rycharde now vnderstonde
Our lorde Salandyn the hygh kynge

If that thou were so hardy a knyght
That thou durste hym abyde in fyght

And come thou after with thy shypmen
For enemyes thou haste I vnderstonde
There in thyne owne londe

Rycharde arose as he wolde wede
And lepte on fauell his good stede
And sayd lordynges or sus or sus
Thus hath vs warned swete Ihesus
On armes he let crye thare
Ayenst the sarasynes for to fare
But Salandyn and his tem

That was to Rycharde moche payne
That he ne myght his hoost ordayne
Before he prycked on fauell
His spere dyde byte full well
Therwith he slewe without doute
Thre kynges of the sowdans route
His hors was styffe hymselfe was good
Hors ne man hym nought withstood
For to hewe many an hethen cors

He that had seen his countenaunce
Wolde hym haue had in remembraunce
They gan on hym as faste dryue
As bees done from the hony hyue
Whome that he hytte with his sworde

The englysshe and frensshe gan after ryde
To fyght they were fresshe that tyde
Upon the sarasynes faste they donge
With swerdes and with launces stronge
And smote harde with theyr myght
And slewe the sarasynes downe ryght
And there was full lytell kepe
So many of them were layde on slepe
That no slaughter without fayle
Ne myght ben seen in that batayle
A myre there was without Iaffe
A myle longe without lasse
Maugre them kynge Rycharde that syre
Thre thousande droue in to the myre
The foule cursed hethen men
Lye and bathe them in the fen
And tho that wolde come vp
Dranke of Rychardes owne cup
What adreynt and what I slawe
The sowdan lost of the hethen lawe
Syxty thousande in a lytell stounde
In the frensshe it is I founde
Tho kynge Rycharde wente ayen
To recomforte hym with his men
Now he was here now he was there
To helpe them with his powere
Ne sawe men neuer as I you tell
One man so many to grounde fell
And in the moost peryll of the batayle

There began an harde shoure
They layde on as they were wode
The valeys ranne all on blode
The longe spaye was a doughty knyght
As he were wode he gan to fyght
The kynge of martok he mette in the felde
With a spere he smote hym in the shelde
That he tombled without fayle 
Toppe sayle ouer his hors tayle

And bad he sholde by hym ryde

And slewe fauell vnder hym
Tho was Rycharde wroth & grym
His axe from the arson he drewe
The sarasynes therwith he slewe
That had stycked vnder hym his stede
Therfore they lost theyr hedes to mede
On fote he was and on fote he layed
Many an hondred vnder hym dayed
All that his axe take myght
Downe he slewe anone ryght
What before and what behynde
A thousande sarasynes in boke I fynde

That came there neuer none to bote 
Salandynes two sones came ryde
And ten thousande sarasynes by theyr syde
And began to crye to kynge Rycharde
Yelde the traytour thou foule cowarde
Or we shall the slee in this place
Thou lyest quod Rycharde by goddes grace 
And with his axe he smote hym so
That his myddell he carued in two
There halfe the body fell downe
And that other halfe abode in the arsowne
Of the sayd Rycharde I am syker
His broder came to that byker
Upon a stede with grete raundowne
As though the worlde sholde fall downe
And gaue Rycharde a woude thorugh the arme
That dyde Rycharde moche harme
For on the spere heed was venym
And Rycharde stoutely smote to hym

Lye there quod Rycharde hethen hounde
Ne shalte thou neuer tell Salandyne
That thou dydest me my lyfe to ryne
Than fyue dukes of hethenesse
Came with theyr hoost more and lesse
And beset aboute Rycharde our kynge
And thought all to deth hym brynge
But Rycharde within a lytell thrawe
The fyue dukes he hath I slawe
And many an hondred after then
All swythe doughty hethen men
At the last though it were late

Tho were our crysten well syker
That they sholde wynne that byker

Brought hym his stede lyarde

And slewe all that he take myght
There was slayne in playne and den

Tho myght Rycharde without leas
Wende to the cyte of Iaffe in peas
