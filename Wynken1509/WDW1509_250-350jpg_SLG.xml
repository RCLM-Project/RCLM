The narrator here refers to the French "rymes" (l. 21) that were not known in England because "lewde man can frensshe none / of an hondred vnneth one" (l. 23-24), or roughly "lewed/unlearned men can [read] in French none of a hundred difficult ones." This sets the stage for telling new gestes or romances in the English vernacular.</note><!--LKN: The explanatory note above needs to cite scholars who have discussed this introduction.-->

In a swounynge she fell downe

In to a chambre she was ladde

The preest sholde make the sakerynge
Out of the chyrche she wolde awaye
But the erle sayd soone naye

For ony thynge that may betyde
She toke her doughter vpon her honde
And Iohan her sone she wolde not wonde
Out of the rofe she gan her dyght
Openly before all theyr syght
Iohan fell frome her in that stonde
And brake his thygh on the grounde
And with her doughter she fled her waye
That neuer after she was I sey
The kynge wondred of that thynge
That she made suche an endynge
For loue that she was serued so
Wolde he neuer after come there ne go
He let ordeyne after his endynge
His sone Rycharde to be kynge
Crowned after kynge Harry
Thus was Rychard sykerly
That was in his .xv. yere
He was a man of grete powere
Dedes of armes he gaue hym to
As falleth for kynges and knyghtes to do
He waxed so stronge and so wyght
Ayest hym had no man no myght
In euery stede he toke honoure

281jpg, l. 911 <note type="text" resp="#SLG" corresp="#wynken1509_281jpg">Woodcut. Image takes up the top third of the page. The foreground depicts a man on the right and a woman on the left, in ornate robes that reach the floor; the man wears a crown and the woman a head covering. The woman leans against the man, his left hand on her chest and her right hand on his left wrist. Based on the placement of the woodcut in the narrative, this couple most likely depicts Margery and Richard; however, it could also represent the German king and queen in grief upon the death of their son. There is a window to the foregrounded couple's right and what appears to be a tapestry behind them. Depicted in the background are four figures, two men and two women: the men wear hats with feathers and the women are dressed similarly to the woman in the foreground. The two pairs engage in conversation with one other, in a seemingly distinct scene from the embracing couple in the foreground. The image is framed by a border of two lines on the upper, lower, and right edges, and by one line on the left.</note>

For trauayll that they had had before
Thus they dwelled halfe a yere
Amonge theyr frendes of grete powere

The kynge commaunded thorugh the londe
At London to make a parlyament

And redy they founde theyr flete

They shypped armure man and stede
And other store folke to fede
They shypped all by the see stronde

In pauylyons square and rounde
And eyther of them kyste other
And became sworne brother

To do kynge Rycharde dystaunce

Wolde hym haue dryuen out of his londe

And sente after his barownes

And whan they were comen euerychone

And tolde how the kynge of fraune
Had hym warned of a dystaunce
Kynge Roger spake fyrste aboue
And smote peas with his gloue
Mercy my fader at this tyme
Kynge Rycharde is a pylgryme
And crossed in to the holy londe
That wryte lyeth I vnderstonde
I dare for kynge Rycharde swere
That he neuer thought you to fere
But sende to hym a messengere
That he come vnto you here
He wyll come to you full soone
And his thought he wyll tell you anone
The kynge was glad of that counsayle
And sente after hym without fayle
On the morowe he came to hym Iwys
In to the ryche cyte of thys
And founde kynge Tanker in his hall
Amonge his erles and barons all
Eyther grette other in fayre maner
With mylde wordes and deboner
Than sayd Tanker to kynge Rycharde
Lo syr kynge by saynt Leonarde

Of a frende here ryght well wrytte

For to slee many a paynym
Than for to greue a crysten kynge
That neuer the mysdyde no thynge
Kynge Rycharde was sore asshamed
And also of his wordes agramd
And sayd Tanker thou arte mystought
For to haue this in thy thought
And suche a rage on me to bere
That I the sholde with armes dere
Suche a treason on me to touche
And on my flesshe I bere the crouche
I ne wyll dwell here but a daye
To morowe I wyll wende my waye
And I praye the syr Tanker kynge
Drocure me none euyll thynge
For many men weneth to greue other
And on his heed falleth the fother
For who so wayteth me despyte
Hym selfe shall nought passe quyte
