The narrator here refers to the French "rymes" (l. 21) that were not known in England because "lewde man can frensshe none / of an hondred vnneth one" (l. 23-24), or roughly "lewed/unlearned men can [read] in French none of a hundred difficult ones." This sets the stage for telling new gestes or romances in the English vernacular.</note><!--LKN: The explanatory note above needs to cite scholars who have discussed this introduction.-->

In a swounynge she fell downe

The preest sholde make the sakerynge
Out of the chyrche she wolde awaye
But the erle sayd soone naye

For ony thynge that may betyde
She toke her doughter vpon her honde
And Iohan her sone she wolde not wonde
Out of the rofe she gan her dyght
Openly before all theyr syght
Iohan fell frome her in that stonde
And brake his thygh on the grounde
And with her doughter she fled her waye
That neuer after she was I sey
The kynge wondred of that thynge
That she made suche an endynge
For loue that she was serued so
Wolde he neuer after come there ne go
He let ordeyne after his endynge
His sone Rycharde to be kynge
Crowned after kynge Harry
Thus was Rychard sykerly
That was in his .xv. yere
He was a man of grete powere
Dedes of armes he gaue hym to
As falleth for kynges and knyghtes to do
He waxed so stronge and so wyght
Ayest hym had no man no myght
In euery stede he toke honoure

281jpg, l. 911 <note type="text" resp="#SLG" corresp="#wynken1509_281jpg">Woodcut. Image takes up the top third of the page. The foreground depicts a man on the right and a woman on the left, in ornate robes that reach the floor; the man wears a crown and the woman a head covering. The woman leans against the man, his left hand on her chest and her right hand on his left wrist. Based on the placement of the woodcut in the narrative, this couple most likely depicts Margery and Richard; however, it could also represent the German king and queen in grief upon the death of their son. There is a window to the foregrounded couple's right and what appears to be a tapestry behind them. Depicted in the background are four figures, two men and two women: the men wear hats with feathers and the women are dressed similarly to the woman in the foreground. The two pairs engage in conversation with one other, in a seemingly distinct scene from the embracing couple in the foreground. The image is framed by a border of two lines on the upper, lower, and right edges, and by one line on the left.</note>

Amonge theyr frendes of grete powere

At London to make a parlyament

And redy they founde theyr flete

And eyther of them kyste other
And became sworne brother

Wolde hym haue dryuen out of his londe

And sente after his barownes

And whan they were comen euerychone

And tolde how the kynge of fraune
Had hym warned of a dystaunce
Kynge Roger spake fyrste aboue
And smote peas with his gloue
Mercy my fader at this tyme
Kynge Rycharde is a pylgryme
And crossed in to the holy londe
That wryte lyeth I vnderstonde
I dare for kynge Rycharde swere
That he neuer thought you to fere
But sende to hym a messengere
That he come vnto you here
He wyll come to you full soone
And his thought he wyll tell you anone
The kynge was glad of that counsayle
And sente after hym without fayle
On the morowe he came to hym Iwys
In to the ryche cyte of thys
And founde kynge Tanker in his hall
Amonge his erles and barons all
Eyther grette other in fayre maner
With mylde wordes and deboner

Lo syr kynge by saynt Leonarde

Of a frende here ryght well wrytte

For to slee many a paynym

That neuer the mysdyde no thynge
Kynge Rycharde was sore asshamed
And also of his wordes agramd
And sayd Tanker thou arte mystought
For to haue this in thy thought
And suche a rage on me to bere
That I the sholde with armes dere
Suche a treason on me to touche
And on my flesshe I bere the crouche
I ne wyll dwell here but a daye
To morowe I wyll wende my waye
And I praye the syr Tanker kynge
Drocure me none euyll thynge
For many men weneth to greue other
And on his heed falleth the fother
For who so wayteth me despyte

With queyntyse and with strength of honde
Of frensshe and of gryffons

I haue a castell I vnderstonde
Is made of tembre of Englonde
With syxe stages full of tourelles
Well flourysshed with cornelles
Therin I and many a knyght
Ayenst the frensshe shall take the fyght
That castell shall haue a sory nom
It shall hyght the mate gryffon
Maryners arme your shyppes
And do vp your manshyppes
By the water halfe ye them assayle
And we wyll by londe saunce fayle
For come ye neuer to me
Tyll I of them awreked be
Therto men myght here crye
Helpe god and saynt Mary
The maryners gan to hye
Bothe with shyppe and with galye
Syth ore spredde and sayle also
Towarde them they gan go
The knyghtes framed the tre castyll
Before the cyte vpon an hyll
All this sawe the kynge fraunce
And sayd haue ye no doutaunce
Of all these englysshe cowardes
For they ne be but losardes
But reyse vp your mangenell
And caste to theyr tre castell
And shote to them with arblast
The tayled dogges for to agast
Now harken of Rycharde our kynge
How he let bere in the dawnynge

Terges and hardes his folke all
Ryght before the cyte wall
His hoost he let at ones crye
Men myght it here in the skye
Now let come the frensshe losardes
And gyue batayll to the taylardes
Þe frensshe men them armed all
And ranne on fast vpon the wall
And began the englysshe for to assayle
There began a stronge batayle
The englysshe shotte with arblast & bowe
Frensshe and gryffons felde and slowe
The galeys came vnto the cyte
And had nygh wonne entre
And harde myned vnder the wall
That many gryffons gan downe fal
With hoked arowes and eke quarelles
Helde them out of the tourelles
And brake bothe legges and armes
And eke theyr neckes it was none harmes
The frensshe men came to the stoure
And caste wylde fyre out of the toure
Wherwith I wote forsothe Iwys
They brente and slewe many englysshe
And the englysshe men defended them welee
With good swerdes of  browne stele
And slewe of them so grete chepes
That there laye moche folke on hepes
And at the londe gate kynge Rycharde
Helde his assawte lyke harde
And so manly he toke one
He lefte of his men neuer one

Kynge Rycharde and he hym tolde
Tales in Englysshe stoute and bolde
A lorde he sayd I aspye now ryght
A thynge that maketh myn herte lyght
Here he sayd is a gate one
That hath warde ryght none
The folke is gone to the water toure
For to do them theyr socoure
And there we may without dente

Blythe therof was kynge Rycharde
Stoutly he wente thederwarde
Many a knyght doughty of dede
After prycked vpon theyr stede
Kynge Rycharde entred without dred
Hym folowed full grete ferhede
His baner vpon the wall he pulte
Many a gryffon it byhulte
As greyhoundes stryken out of lese
Kynge Ryeharde threste amonge the prese
Seuen chaynes with his good swerde

That were drawen for grete doute
Within the gates and without
Porcules and gates vp he wan
And lette come in euery man
Men myght se by strete and lane
Frensshe and gryffons gaue bane
And some to horse ran in haste
Dores and wyndowes barred faste

And euer men bare them vp with leuours
And slewe them with grete vygours
All that they founde ayenst them stonde
Passed thorugh dethes honde
They brake cofers and toke tresours
Golde and syluer and countours
Jewelles stones and spycery
All that they founde in tresoury
There was none of englylshe blode
That he ne had as moche gode
As they wolde drawe or bere
To shyppe or to pauylyons I swere
And euer cryed kynge Rycharde
Slee downe euery frensshe cowarde
And ken them in bataylles
That ye haue no tayles
The kynge of fraunce came pryckynge
Ayenst Rycharde our kynge
And fell on knees downe of his hors
And bad mercy for goddes corps
For the crowne and for the loue
Of Ihesu cryste kynge aboue
And for the vyage and for the crose

And he wolde haue honde take
They sholde amende all the wrake

And bad Rycharde be his soules leche
And the tresoure yelde agayne than

And elles he ne myght in goddes paye
To Iherusalem take the waye

They myght nought amende the dyshonoure
And that they haue done me or this
And syr also thou dyde amys

To appyre me with thy lesynge

Who breketh our pylgrymage he is forlorne

Upon two stede ryde

Aboue the eye vpon the pan
The skull brake with that dente
The ryght eye slewe out quytemente
And he fell downe deed in haste
Hewe of Impetyte was a gaste
And prycked awaye without fayle
And Rycharde was soone at his tayle
And gaue hym a stroke on the molde
That deed he thought be he sholde
Ternes and quernes he gaue hym there
And sayd syr thus thou shalte lere
To myssaye thy ouerhedlynge
Go playne now to your frensshe kynge
An archebysshop came full soone
He fell on knees and badde a bone
Of kynge Rycharde he had his grace
That he wolde leue his stryfe in that place
And there no more harme do
For goddes loue the people to

And spoyled the quycke all naked

And in to pryson hondredes fyue
And also naked syxty score
As they were of theyr moders bore
Of the shyppes brekynge they were blythe
The Iustyces of Cyprys ran full swythe
And drewe vp cofers many folde
Full of syluer and of golde
Dysshes cuppes broches and rynges
Cuppes of golde and ryche thynges
