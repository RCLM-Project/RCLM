	¶ The prologue. 

  Orde kynge of glorye
Suche grace and suche vyctory
Thou sendest to kynge Rycharde
That neuer was founde cowarde
It is good to here Iestes
Of his prowesse and his conquestes
Many romayns men make newe
Of good knyghtes and of trewe
Of theyr dedes men rede romauns 
Bothe in Englonde and in Fraunce
Of Rowlande and of Olyuere
And of euery desepere 
Of Alysaunder and of Charlemayne
Of kynge Arthur and of Gawayne
How they were knyghtes good and curtoys
Of Turpyn and of Oger the danoys 
Of troye men rede in ryme
What was by olde tyme
Of Hector and of Achylles
What folke they slewe in prees
In fraunce these rymes were wrought
Euery englysshe ne knewe it nought
Lewde man can frensshe none
Of an hondred vnneth one
Neuertheles with gladde chere
Of that ye wyll now here
Newe Iestes I vnderstonde
Of doughty knyghtes of Englonde
Therefore now I wyll you rede
Of a kynge doughty of dede

252jpg
Kynge Rycharde was the beste
That is founde in ony Ieste
Now all that here this talkynge
God gyue them good endynge

         ¶ Here begynneth the hystroye of Kynge Ry:
        charde cure du lyon / and furst of his byrth. 

L Ordes harken now beforne
How kynge Rycharde was borne
His fader was cleped kynge Harry
In his tyme sykerly
As I fynde in this sawe
Saynt Thomas was Islawe
At Caunterbury before the auter stone
There myracles be done many one
Whan he was .xx. wynter olde
He was a kynge swythe bolde
He wolde no wyfe I vnderstonde
With grete tresour thoughe they her fonde
Neuertheles his barons hym redde
That he graunted them a wyfe to wedde
Hastely he sente his sonde
In to many a dyuers londe
The fayrest woman that was on lyue
Messengers be redy dyght
To shyppe they wente that same nyght
And theyr sayle vp they drowe
The wynde them serued well Inowe
And they came amyddes the see
No wyndes brethe ne had he
   Kynnge R.		+		A.ii.  

253jpg
Therfore they were swythe wo
Another shyppe they encountred tho
Suche ne sawe they neuer none
For it was so gay begone
Euery nayle with golde Igraue
Of pure golde was his sklaue
Her mast was of Iuory
Of samyte her sayle wytly
Her ropes all of whyte sylke
As whyte as euer was ony mylke
The noble shyppe was without
With clothes of golde spred about
And her lofte and her wyndlace
All with golde depaynted was
In the shyppe there were dyght
Knyghtes and lordes of myght
And a lady therin was
Bryght as sonne throwe the glas
Her men abrode gan stonde
And becked them with her honde
And prayed them for to dwell
And theyr auentures to tell
They graunted all with skyll
For to tell all her wyll
To dyuerse londes do we wende
For kynge Harry hath vs sende
For to seche hym a quene
The fayrest that myght on erth bene
Up arose a kynge of a chayre
With that worde and spake fayre
The chayre was of carbunkel  stone
Suche saw they neuer none

254jpg
And other dukes hym besyde
Noble men of moche pryde
And welcomed the messengers euerychone
Into the shyppe they gan gone
Thyrty knyghtes without lye
For sothe was in that company
In that ryche shyppe they wente
The messengers that were sente
Knyghtes and ladyes came them agayne
Seuen score as men sayne
And welcomed them at one worde
Clothes of sylke were spred on borde
The kynge than anone badde
As it is in ryme radde
That his doughter were forth fet
And in a chayre by hym set
Trumpettes began to blowe
She was set in a throwe
With .xx. knyghtes her aboute
And double so many of ladyes stoute
All they began to knele her to
For it was reason so to do
They ete and dranke [and]  were glad
For so the ryche kynge bad
Whan they had done theyr mete
Of auentures they began to speke
The kynge them tolde in his reason
How it came hym in a vysyon
In his londe that he came fro
In to Englonde for to go
And his doughter that was hym dere
For to wende with hym in fere
Kynge R.	     +			A.iii. 

255jpg
And in this maner we be dyght
Unto your londe to wende ryght
Than answered a messengere
His name was cleped Barnagere
Ferther wyll we seke nought
To my lorde she shall be brought
Whan he her with eye doth se
Full well apayed wyll he be
The wynde rose out of the north west
And serued them with the best
At the toure they gan aryue
To londe the knyghtes wente blyue
The messengers the kynge hath tolde
Of that lady fayre and bolde
There he laye in toure
The lady that was whyte as floure
Kynge Harry gan hym soon dyght
With erles barons and many a knyght
Ayenst that lady for to wende
For he was courteys and hende
The damoysell to londe was ladde
Clothes of golde before her spradde
The messengers on eche a syde
And mynstrelles of moche pryde
Kynge Harry lyked her seynge
That fayre lady and her fader the kynge
And sayd to hym ryght so
Ye be welcome all me to
To westmyster they wente in fere
Lordes ladyes that there were
Trumpettes began for to blowe
To mete they went in a throwe

256jpg
Knyghtes there serued a good spede
Of theyr mete to tell it is no nede
And after mete in hyenge
Speketh Harry our kynge
To the kynge that sate in same
Good syr what is your name
My name he sayd is Carbarrynge
Of antyoche I am the kynge
He told him his reason
How hym came in vysyon
Syr he sayd I tell the
I had brought elles more meyne
Many mo without fayle
And mo shyppes with vytayle
Yet asked he that lady bryght
What name my lady ye hyght
Cosodorean without lesynge
Thus answered she the kynge
Damoysell he sayd bryght and shene
Wyll we dwell and be my quene
She answered with wordes styll
Syr I am at my faders wyll
Her fader graunted swythe sone
At your wyll it shall be done
Hastely that she be wedde
As a quene to a kynges bedde
And prayd hym for his courtesy
It myght be done all pryuely
The spousynge was done that nyght
Therat daunsed many a knyght
Moche Ioye was them amonge
A preest ful soone the masse song
     Kynge R.		       +			A.iiii. 

257jpg
And whan it came to the leuacyowne  
In a swounynge she fell downe
The people than her sore a dradde
In to a chambre she was ladde
She sayd for I am thus hent
I dare neuer se the sacrament
Upon the more her fader toke leue
No lenger wolde he there be leue
The kynge dwelled with his quene
Chyldren they had them bytwene
Two sones and a mayd
Forsothe as the boke vs sayd
Rycharde hyght the fyrst Iwys
Wherfore these romayns made is
And Iohan forsothe that other was
And theyr syster hyght Copyas
Thus they dwelled in fere
Tyll the .xv. yere
Upon a daye before the rode
The kynge a t his masse stode
There came an erle of grete poste
Syr he sayd how may this be
That my lady the quene
The sacrament dare not sene
Gyue vs leue to do her dwell
Fro the begynnynge of the gospell
Tyll the mass be songe and sayd
And than shall ye se a queynt brayd
The kynge graunted with good wyll
For to holde her with strength styll
Neyther for wele ne for woo
Let her not out of the chyrche goo 

258jpg
And whan the bell began to rynge
The preest sholde make the sakerynge
Out of the chyrche she wolde awaye 
But the erle sayd soone naye
He sayd lady thou shalte abyde
For ony thynge that may betyde
She toke her doughter vpon her honde
And Iohan her sone she wolde not wonde
Out of the rofe she gan her dyght
Openly before all theyr syght
Iohan fell frome her in that stonde
And brake his thygh on the grounde
And with her doughter she fled her waye
That neuer after she was I sey
The kynge wondred of that thynge
That she made suche an endynge
For loue that she was serued so
Wolde he neuer after come there ne go
He let ordeyne after his endynge
His sone Rycharde to be kynge
Crowned after kynge Harry
Thus was Rychard sykerly
That was in his .xv. yere
He was a man of grete powere
Dedes of armes he gaue hym to
As falleth for kynges and knyghtes to do
He waxed so stronge and so wyght
Ayest hym had no man no myght
In euery stede he toke honoure
As a noble kynge and conqueroure

¶ How kynge Rycharde made a Iustynge. 

259
[image]
The fyrst yere that he was kynge
At Salysbury he made a Iustynge
And commau[n]ded euery man to be there
Both with shelde and with spere
Erles and barons euerychone
At home ne dwelled neuer one
On forfeyture on lyfe and londe
For no thyne that they ne wonde
This was cryed I vnderstonde
Thorughout all Englonde
All was for to loke and se
The knyghtes that best myght be
There they came all at his wyll
His commaundement to fulfyll
The partyes were sonder set
Togyder they ran without let

260
Kynge Rycharde gan hym dysguyse
In a full stronge queyntyse
He came out of a valaye
For to se of theyr playe,
As a knyght auenturous
His atyre was orgulous
All togyder cole blacke
Was his horse without lacke
Upon his creste a reuen stode
That yaned as he were wode
And aboute his necke a bell
Wherefore the reason I shall you tell
The oynge of the rauen is
In a trauayll for to be Iqys
Sygnyfyauence of the bell
With holy chyrche to dwell
And them to noy and to geue
That be not in the ryght byleue
He bare a shafte that was grete and stronge
It was fourtene fote longe
And it was grete and stoute
One and twenty inches aboute
The fyrst knyght that he tehre mette
Full egerly he hym grette 
With a dente amyd the shelde
His horse he bare downe in the felde
And the knyght fell to grounde
Full nye deed in that stounde
THe nexte that he mette thare
A grete stroke hy hym bare
His forgette with his cornell tho
His necke he brake there a two

261jpg
His horse and he fell to grounde
And dyed bothe in that stounde
Kynge Rycharde gane houe + abyde
Ȝf ony mo wolde to hym ryde
Trumpettes began for to blowe
Knyghtes Iusted in that rowe
Another knyght hardy and good
Sate on a stede rede as blode
He dyde hym arme and well dyght
In all that longed to suche a knyght
A shafte he toke grete and louge
That was so heuy and stronge
And sayd he wolde to hym ryde
Yf he durste hym abyde
Trumpettes began to blowe than
Therby wyste many a man
That they sholde Iuste mere
The noble knyghtes that there were
Kynge Rycharde of hym was ware
And a spere to hym he bare
And encountred hym inthe felde
He bare awaye halfe his shelde
His pusen therwith gane gone
And also his brandellet bone
His vyser and his gorgere
Hym repented that be came there
Kynge Rycharde houed and behelde
And thought to rest hym in the felde
Yf there were other knyght or swayne
That wolde more ryde hym agayne
He sawe there wolde come none
On his way he gan forth gone

262jpg
Into a wode out of theyr syght
And in another tyre he hym dyght
Upon a stede rede as blode
With all the tyre that on hym stode
Horse and shelde armure and man
That no man sholde knower hym than
Upon his creste a rede hounde
The tayle henge to the grounde
That was sygnyfycacyon
The heathen folke to brynge downe
Them to slee for goddes loue
And crysten men to brynge aboue
Styll he houed and bode yore
To them he thought to ryde more
He rode the thronge all aboute
He helde within and withoute
A baron he sawe hym besyde
Towarde hym he gan ryde
To a squyer he toke his spere
TO hym he wolde it not bere
Forth he toke a mansell
A stroke he thought to be set well
On his helme that was so stronge
Of that dente the fyre out spronge
The baron tourned hym asyde
And sayd felowe forth thou ryde
With thy speres go and playe
Come no more here I the praye
And sykerly yf thou do
Thou salte haue a knocke or two
Kynge Rycharde wondred in his thought
That he set his stroke at nought

263jpg
And came agayne by another waye
And thought to make a better paye
In his styrope vp he stode
And smote the hym with Ire full mode
He set his stroke on his yron hat
But that other in his sadell sat
Hastely without wordes mo
His mase he toke in his honde tho
That was made of yotyn bras
He wondred who that it was 
Suche a stroke he hym lente
That Rycharde feet out of his steropes wente
For plate ne for acketton
For hawberke ne for campeson
Suche a stroke he neuer had none ore
That dyde hym halfe so moche sore
Full swythe awaye he gan ryde
Out of the prees there besyde
To hym selfe he sayd tho
Of suche strokes kepe I no mo
He wente adowne to a well
And with his helme dranke his fell
And he watred his stede also
In the thyrde atyre he let hym do
All his atyre whyte as mylke
His croper was of sylke
Upon his shulder a crosse rede
That betokeneth goddes dede
With his enemyyes for to fyght
To wynne that crosse yf that he myght
Upon his heed a doue whyte
Sygnyfycacyon of the holy spyryte

264jpg
To be bolde to wynne the pryse
And dystroye goddes enemyes
To the kynge Rycharde gan hym dyght
Than another noble knyght
Fouke doly was his name
The kynge kym loued for his game
To hym a stroke he dyght
Well to paye with all his myght
He smote hym on his bassenet
A grete dente without let
if swouned to his cheke bone
Syr Fouke had hym forth gone
That he no lenger abyde
In auenture yf ony stroke betyde
The kynge sawe he felte no sore
And thought to gyue hym more
And another stroke hy hym brayde
His mase vpon his heed he layde
With good wyll that stroke he set
The baron thought he wolde hym let
And with his heuy mase of stele
There he gaue the kynge his dele
That his helme all to roue
And he ouer his sadell droue
And his steropes he forbare
Such a stroke had he neuer are
He was so astonyed of that dente
That nye he had his lyfe lente
And for that stroke that hym was gyuen
He ne wyst whether it was daye or euen
Tho he recouered of his swowe
To his palays he hym drowe

265jpg
Than he commaunded hastely
Herodes for to make crye
And euery man for to wende
Home to his owne frende
The kynge anone a messengere
Full preuely he sente there
To syr Thomas of multon
That was a noble baron
And to syr Fouke dely
That they come to hyme on hye
Let them not dwell in no manere
Bydde them come bothe in fere
The messengers therwith wente
And sayd the kynge after them sente
Swythe for to come hym to
Without delaye that it be do
The knyghtes hyed and were blythe
To the kynge they wente swythe
And hendly they hym grette
And he them toke and by hym sette
And sayd to them wordes free
Welcome be ye now to me
In eyther honde he toke one
And in to a chambre they gone
Quod Rycharde swete frendes twaye
Tell me the sothe I you praye
What knyghtes that rode best cours
Of this Iustes paramours
And whiche coude best his crafte
For to demene well his shafte
With dentes for to fell his foos
Whiche of them wan the loos

266jpg
And who styffest tymbre brake
Quod Thomas one in a tyre blake
Came pryckynge ouer falower and felde
All that there was hym behelde
How he rode as he were wode
A come he houed and withstode
On his creste a rauen swarte
And he ne helde with neyther parte
A shafte he bare styfe and stronge
Fourtene fote it was longe
It was bothe styffe and stoute
Anone he asked all the route
Yf ony durst come and proue
A course for his lemmans loue
With a knyght of auenturous here
A yonge knyght a Ioly bachelere
Hente a shafte and stede bestrode
To the auenturous knyght he rode
The auenturous with hym met
Suche a stroke on his shelde he set
That horse and man ouerthrewe
There was no wyght that hym knewe
Trompettes yede herodes gaderynge
All the other knyghtes of hym had dredynge
To Iuste with hym efte with launce
The auenturous betyde so fayre chaunce
An hardy knyght stoute and sauage
Hente a shafte with stronge rage
Now hath he one of oures felde
Worth we neuer for men telde
Syth he hath done vs that dyspyte
yf he agayne passe quyte
	Kynge R.				+			B.i.

267jpg
That fyrste he haue no knocke
He prycked forth fro all the flocke
With a shafte stoute and square
Amydde the course than met they thare
The auenturous smote his shelde amydde
A wonders case our knyght betydde
The auenturous felde hym with Ire
Downe of his stede and brake his swyre
The thre knyghtes to speke began
This is the deuyll and no man
That our folke felleth and sleeth
Tyde me lyfe tyde me deeth
I shall mete hym yf I may
The quenturous knyght with grete deray
So harde to our knyght he droue
His shelde in two peces he cloue
His shulder with his shafte he bracke
And bare hym ouer his horse backe
That he fell downe and brake his arme
He dyde hym no more harme
The auenturous tho tourned ayene
And houed styll for to sene
Who wolde Iuste with hym more
Of hym they were adradde full sore
No man durste Iuste with hym efte
Leste he them theyr lyfe berefts
What he sawe there came no mo
He rode agayne there he came fro
After the blacke another came
All the folke gaue hym good name
His horse and his atyre was rede
He semed well to be a quede

268jpg
A rede hounde on his helme aboue
He came to seche and to proue
Ȝf ony knyght Iuste with hym dare
Of no man tho was he ware
That hym made chalenge
He rode downe tho by the renge
The deuyll hym hange where euer he be
I wote not what hym ayled at me
His shafte tho his squyre he toke
And behelde me with a grym loke
And smote me so with his mase
Ne had be Ijesu crystes grace
My swyre had gone awaye
I bad hym ryde forth his waye
And dele with foles as his selfe was
Agayne he came by another pas
And gaue me a worse buffate
But styll in my sadell I sate
Than sayd many a moders sone
Alas syr Thomas of multone
That is smyten without skyll
My mase I hente with good wyll
And smote hym that all folkes saye
Downe of his horse withouten naye
Whan I had hym a stroke set
And wolde haue blyssed hym bet
No mo strokes wolde he abyde
But awaye soone he gan ryde
What multon has his tale tolde
Syr Fouke doly a baron bolde
Sayd to kynge Rycharde
The thyrde there came soone afterwarde
	Kynge R.			+			B.ii.

269jpg
His atyre was whyte as snowe
Therof many one there lower
In his shelde a crosse rede as blode
A whyte doue on his helme stode
He houed styll and behelde vs yerne
yf there were ony knyght so sterne
So hardy a man and stronge of bones
That durst Iuste with hym ones
There was none so stoute ne grym
That durst Iuste ones with hym
Downe by the renge he went faste
To me he came at the laste
Forsothe syr kynge quod Fouke than
I wende he had ben a symple man
With his mase on my bassenet
A stroke vpon my helme he set
With wrathe stronge and eger mayne
That nygh all stonyed was my brayne
I spake to hym wordes fewe
And badde hym ryde worth wood shrewe
And playe with them that be thy pere
yf thou come ofte in this manere
For to be wyse I shall the teche
Efte he came agayne to seche
A worse stroke he gaue me tho
And my mase I drewe me to
And a stroke I hym set
Euen vpon his bassenet
That bothe his styropes he lese
And he hyed hym faste out of the prese
Home towarde the wodde bowe
Kynge Rycharde sate and fastelowe

270jpg
And sayd frendes sykerly
Take it not in grefe for it was I
Whan ye were gadred in free
Auenturous I came in this manere
Who was strongest you to assaye
And who that coude best strokes paye
Lordes he sayde wote ye ought
What I haue ordeyned in thought
The holy londe to wende to
We thre without ony mo
All in palmers guyse
The holy londe to deuyse
To me I wolde that ye were sworne
No man to knowe it that is borne
Neyther for wele ne for woo
Tyll that we be come and goo
They graunted hym his askynge
Without ony withsayenge
With hym to lyue and to dye
Lettynge for loue ne for enuye
On the boke they layde theyr honde
To that forwarde for to stonde
Tho they asked all thre
Trewe sworne for to be
Trompettes blewe and made crye
To mete they wente hastely
And on the .xii. daye at ende
They were red for to wende
With pycke and with slauayne
As palmers or panayme

N		Ow they dyght them full yare
		These thre knyghtes fore to fare
		They set vp sayle y[] wynde was good
		And sayled ouer the salte flood
		In to falunders as I you saye
Kynge Rycharde and his feres twaye
Forth they wente with gladde chere
Thorugh many londes farre and mere
Tyll they came to blaundys
That is a coste of moche pryse
A noble shyppe they founde thare
Ouer the see for to fare

272jpg
The sayle was reysed in the shyppe stronge
And in the see they were longe
There they dwelled forty dayes
For to lerne the londes layes
Syth they dyde them to the see
Towarde Acrys that ryche cyte
And so forth to masydoyne
And to the cyte of Babyloyne
And so forth to sysare
Of nynyue they were ware
And also of Iherusalem
And to the cyte of bedleem
And to the cyte of gandon turry
And also to obedy
And to the castell of orgulous
And to the cyte of apparylous
To Iaffe and to saffrayne
To bryght and to betayne
Thus they vysyted the holy londe
How they myght it wynne to theyr honde
And syth homewarde they them dyght
To englonde with all theyr myght
Whan they had passed the grekes see
In almayne the palmers thre
There they wrought or they thens myght goo
That tourned them to moche woo
I shall you tell in what manere
Now harken all that ben here
A goos they dyght to theyr dynere
In a tauerne there they were
Kynge Rycharde the fyre fet
And Thomas to the spytte hym set

273jpg
Fouke doly made the bose
Full dere bought they the gose
And as they were etynge theyr fyll
Anone there came in a mynstryll
And sayd good men sykerly
Wyll ye haue ony mynstrelsy
Kynge Rycharde bad hym thens go
That tourned them to moche wo
The mynstrell toke that in mynde
And thought that they were vnkynde
And yf I may they shall forthynke
For they bad me neyther ete ne drynke
For gentylles sholde bydden
To glee men that aboute yeden
Of theyr mete wyne or ale
For lose ryseth of mynstrale
They were englysshe well he knewe
By speche and syght hyde and hewe
For he wente in that tyde
To a castell there besyde
And tolde the kynge all and some
That thre men were to the cyte come
Stronge men bolde and fere
In the worlde is not theyr pere
Kynke Rycharde of englonde was the one man
Fouke doly was that other than
The thyrde Thomas of Multon
Noble knyghtes of renowne
In palmers wede they be dyght
That no man sholde knowe them ryght
To hym sayd the kynge Iwys
That thou haste yf it sothe is

274jpg
Thou shalte haue thy warysowne
And chose they selfe a ryche towne
The kynge co[m]mau[n]ded his knyghtes
To arme them in all myghtes
And go and take them all thre
And swythe brynge them to me
Forth wente the knyghtes in fere
And toke the palmers at theyr dynere
They were brought before the kynge
And he asked them in hyenge
Palmers he sayd whens be ye
Of Englonde they sayd we be
What hyght thou falower sayde the kynge
Rycharde he sayd without lesynge
What hyght thou he sayd to the elder man
Fouke doly he answered than
And what thou he sayd gray here
Thomas of multon he sayd there
The kynge asked them all thre
What they dyde in his countre
I saye you without lyes
Ye seme well to be spyes
Ye haue sene my londe vp and downe
I trowe ye thynke me some treasowne
For as moche as thou syr kynge
And thy barons without lesynge
Seme not to be thus dyght
Therefore ye shall with law + ryght
Ben uot in astronge pryson
For ye thynke to do me treason

For auentures that may betyde
In straunge londes where thou ryde

And his felawes with hym tyte
Lenger had they no respyte
Tyll that other daye at pryme
The kynges sone came in euyll tyme
Wardrewe was his name
He was a knyght of grete fame
He was grete stronge and fere
In that londe was not his pere

Badde they sholde haue theyr fyll
Bothe of drynke and eke of mete

And in to bedde be brought to reste
To quyte his that he be preste

On the morowe whan it was daye
Rycharde rose as I you saye
Waxe he toke clere and bryght
And sone a fyre he hym dyght
And wexed his hondes by the fyre
Ouerthwarde and endlonge be you sure
A strawes brede thycke and ore
For he thought to smyte sore
With his honde he hath tyght
To make a payne that he hath hyght

Flesshe and skynne awaye he tare
That he fell downe in grete care

That he was deed as ony stone
A knyght sterte to the kynge
And tolde hym that tydynge
That rycharde has his sone sloo
Alas he sayd how shall I doo
With that worde he fell to grounde
As a man that was in wo bounde
He foundred and lost his fete
Knyghtes toke hym vp without lete
And sayd syr let be thy thought
Now it is it done helpeth nought
The kynge spake wordes on hye
To the knyghtes that stode hym bye
Tell me swythe of this cas
In what maner that it done was
Styll they stode euerychone
For sorowe myght they tell none
With that noyse came the quene
Alas she sayd how may this bene
Why is this sorowe and this fare
Who hath brought you in care
Dame he sayd wotest thou nought
Thy fayre sone to deth is brought

Syth I was borne to man
Suche sorowe had neuer woman
All my Ioye is tourned to woo
For sorowe I wolde my selfe sloo
Whan the quene vnderstode
For grete care she waxed ny wode
Her kerchers she drewe and heer also
Alas she sayd what shall I do
She cratched her selfe in the vysage
As a woman that was in a rage
She fomed all on blode
And rente her robe that she in stode
And sayd alas that I was borne
That thus my sone haue forlorne
Lorde she sayd how may this be
These knyghtes he sayd tolde it me
Now tell the sothe the kynge sayd than

And but ye the sothe sey

And badde he sholde stonde nere

Syr greue you no thynge

The whiche hym axed at his comynge
Canst thou me tell in what manere
On Rycharde that I auenged were

Ye wote well it is no lawe
A kynge to hange ne to drawe
Therfore do by my reason
Hastely take your lyon
And with holde hym his mete

And Rycharde in a chambre do
And put the lyon than hym do
In this maner he shall be slawe
Than doost thou not ayenst the lawe

And than bethought her soone
And after hym soone she sent
To warne hym of that Iugement

Awaye to wende without leue
The kynge I wyll not so greue
Of the lyon gyue I nought
Hym to slee haue I thought
By pryme vpon the thyrde daye
I wyll haue his herte to praye
Kerchers he asked of sylke
Fourty elles as whyte as mylke
In to the pryson ye them brynge
A lytell before the euenynge
Whan it to the tyme came
The mayde to pryson the way name
And with her a noble knyghe
Theyr souper was redy dyght

And the porter also 
She bad he sholde so do
That nyght they were glad ynowe
Euery man syth to chambre drowe
And Rycharde and that swete wyght
Togyder dwelled all that nyght
And on the morowe whan it was daye
Rycharde badde her to wende awaye
Naye she sayd by god aboue
I shall here dye for thy loue
Ryght now here I wyll abyde
Though I sholde to deth betyde

Certes hens wyll I not wende
I shall take the grace that god wyll sende
Rycharde sayd fayre lady free
But thou wende soone frome mee
Thou shalte me greue sore
That I shall loue the no more
There ayenst she sayd naye
Lemman haue now good daye
God that dyed on the tre
Saue the yf his wyll be
The keuerchefes he toke on honde
And aboute his arme he wonde
And thought in that ylke whyle
To slee the lyon with some gyle
And syngle in a kyrtell he stode
And abode the lyon fyers and wode
With that came the Iaylere
And other men that with hym were
And the lyon them amonge
His pawes were styffe and stronge
The chambre dore they vndone
And the lyon to hym is gone
Rycharde sayde hepe lorde Ihesu
The lyon made to hym venu
And wolde hym haue all to rente
Kynge Rycharde besyde hym flente
The lyon on the breste hym spurned
That aboute he tourned
The lyon was hongry and megre
And bette his tayle to be egre
He loked aboute as he were madde
Abrode he all his pawes spradde

287jpg

He cryed lowde and yaned wyde
Kynge Rycharde bethought hym that tyde
What hym was best and to hym sterte
In at the throte his honde he gerte
And hente out the herte with his honde
Lounge and all that he there fonde
The lyon fell deed to the grounde
Rycharde felte no wem ne wounde
He fell on his knees in that place
And thanked Ihesu of his grace
That hym kepte from shame and harme
He toke the herte also warme
And brought it forth in the hall
Before the kynge and his lordes all
The kynge at mete sate at the dese
The erles barons proude in prese

Kynge Rycharde thryste out all the blode
And wette the herte in the salte

Without brede he it gan ete
The kynge wondred and began to speke

This his the deuyll and no man
He hath my stronge lyon slawe
The herte out of the body drawe
And hath it eten with good wyll

Fourty thousande good at nede
None therin but men of myght
That were proude in warre to fyght

For he wolde not the folke anoye

For no thynge that myght auayle

Thus defended Medarde the kynge
For he the hateth ouer all thynge
And well he woteth that ye haue swore
All that ye take for to paye fore

Whether ye wyll sethe or bake brede
And to poore men so god you rede
That ye fynde in all the towne
That they come to mete at my sommowne
Whan the mete was dressed and dyght

After the meyre for to wende
And other barons good and hende

And fayre seruyce before them fet

With erles dukes + many a bolde baron

In Englonde was none his better
And also syr Roberte of turname
Moche englysshe people with hym came
And redy they founde theyr flete
Charges with armure drynke and mete
They shypped armure man and stede
And other store folke to fede
They shypped all by the see stronde
To wende in to the holy londe
The wynde was bothe good and kene
And droue them ouer in to messene
Before the gates of the gryffons
Kynge Rycharde pyght his pauylyons
The kynge of fraunce there he founde
In pauylyons square and rounde
And eyther of them kyste other
And became sworne brother
To wende in to the holy londe
To wreke Ihesu I vnderstonde
A reason thought the kynge of fraunce
To do kynge Rycharde dystaunce
To kynge Tanker he sente a wrytte
That tourned hym to lytell wytte
The kynge Rycharde with strength of honde
Wolde hym haue dryuen out of his londe
Tanker kynge of puyle was
For this wryte he sayd alas

He sente anone his messenger 
To his sone that hyght Roger
That was kyng eof Cysyle londe

And sente after his barownes

And whan they were comen euerychone
The kynge sayd to them anone
And tolde how the kynge of fraune
Had hym warned of a dystaunce
Kynge Roger spake fyrste aboue
And smote peas with his gloue
Mercy my fader at this tyme
Kynge Rycharde is a pylgryme
And crossed in to the holy londe
That wryte lyeth I vnderstonde
I dare for kynge Rycharde swere
That he neuer thought you to fere
But sende to hym a messengere
That he come vnto you here
He wyll come to you full soone
And his thought he wyll tell you anone
The kynge was glad of that counsayle
And sente after hym without fayle
On the morowe he came to hym Iwys
In to the ryche cyte of thys
And founde kynge Tanker in his hall
Amonge his erles and barons all
Eyther grette other in fayre maner
With mylde wordes and deboner

Lo syr kynge by saynt Leonarde

And sayd Tanker thou arte mystought
For to haue this in thy thought
And suche a rage on me to bere

Suche a treason on me to touche
And on my flesshe I bere the crouche
I ne wyll dwell here but a daye
To morowe I wyll wende my waye

Of saynt Iohan as I tell by tale
There he let pytche his pauylyon
And let arere vp his matgryffon

And gonners bente and stones caste
Tho syrasynes began to arme them all
And ranne in hasst vnto the wall
In whyte shetes they gan them wrythen
For bytynge of kynge Rychardes flyen
They sayd this man doth vs grete payne
For he doth bothe throwe and mayne
We sawe neuer kynge thus begynne
It is grete doute leste he vs wynne
Kynge Rycharde stode in his matgryffowne
And sawe there dedes in the towne
Whederwarde the sarasynes drewe
And arowes englysshe to them slewe
Out of arblastes arowes smerte
Thorugh lunge leuer arme + herte
The frensshe men with grete noblay
Helped to myne full well that daye
The vttermest wall that daye was downe cast
And many sarasynes slayue at last
That daye Rycharde so well spedde thore
That he was holden for a conquerore
For better he spedde that daye or none
Than all the other in seuen yere had done
The sarasynes myght not endoure
They fledde in to that hye toure
They lyght torches aboute the wall

Syxty thousande men I fynde
Cockes of heye he made them bynde
To go before hastelyche
TO fyll the crysten dyche
To rescowe Acrys they haue rede
And to do the crysten men to dede
After came barons and knyghtes
Stronge in armes stoute in fyghtes

With thre sarasynes hedes of sable

Of balyn bothe shelde and targe

There ye myght se many a wyght man
That quyckly to his armure ran
And wente anone in to the dyche
And defended it hastelyche
There was many a gentyll hewed
Quykly from the body take the hewed
Sheldes fell clouen a two
And many a stede stycked also
Many a knyght lost his harnes
And many a stede drewe theyr tharnes
And many a doughty man saunce fayle

Though his pauylyon had ben in fyre
Therfore the kynge of fraunce made a crye

Thorugh the byddynge of our lady dere
Her blessyd sone herde her prayere
Thorugh his grace and vertue

To wyne ne water ne to no lycour
But after porke he was a longed
Though all his men sholde be honged
They ne myght in that countree

No porke fynde take no gete

To the stewarde he sayd pryuelyche

Take a sarasyne yonge and fat
And in haste that deed be slawe
And his heed of hym be fawe

And kynge Rycharde downe ryght slee
Thus all daye tyll it was nyght

Well I behelde the seruyse than
A knyght brought fro the kechyn
An heed soden of a sarasyn
Without here in a platter brode

Before kynge Rycharde a knyght in haste
Carued hym of the heed and he ete faste
With his tethe he grynded flesshe harde
And as a wood man tho he farde

With his eyen stepe and grym

And gyneth not though thou ware drawe

Sayd alas that they were borne
For now we be all forlorne
For they were wyght men and stronge
Well alwaye we lyue to longe
Alas that we thus be begone

But or he came he was slayne
For he and his sones anone

To slee the sowdan he had thought
And for he myght ouertake hym nought
And of a foteman a bowe he toke
And drewe it vp to the hoke
And shotte it to the sowdan anone
And smote hym thorugh the shulder bone

Fledde frome the batayll of arsure

Fauell of sypres ne lyarde of prys

The messengers tho home wente
And tolde the sowdan in presente
That Rycharde in þ[e] felde wolde come hym to
The ryche sowdan badde to come hym vnto
A noble clerke that coude well contoure
That was a mayster nygromansoure
He commaunded as I you tell
Thorugh the fendes myght of hell
Two stronge fendes of the ayre
In lykenes of two stedes fayre
Bothe lyke of hewe and here
As men sayd that there were
No man sawe neuer none syche
That one was a mare I lyche

Where that he were in ony mede
Were the knyght neuer so bolde
Whan the mare nye wolde

But soone he wolde go her tyll
And knele downe and souke his dame
Therwhyle the sowdan with shame

On hym to ryde haue thou no drede
For he the helpe shall at nede
Purney the a tree grete and stronge
Though it be fourty fote longe
And trusse it ouerthwarte his mane
All that he meteth shall haue theyr bane
With that tree he shall downe fell
It is a fende as I the tell
Ryde on hym in goddes name
For he may do the no shame
Take a brydell sayd the aungell
And make it fast on his mussell
And be the brydell in his mouth
Ryde eest weste north and south
He shall the serue at thy wyll
Whan the sowdan shall ryde the ryll
Take here a spere heed of stele
He hath none armure wrought so wele
But it be perysshed be thou bolde
Whan the aungell had thus I tolde

Seuen sowdans with grete route
Of that cyte were sente oute

Of grete meruayll I wyll you saye
That daye was tolde without lesynge
Of sowdans and of hygh kynges

Lyke as snowe lyeth on the mountaynes
So were full fylled hylles and playnes
With hawberkes bryght + harneys clere
Of trumpettes and of tabourere
To here the noyse it was grete wonder
As the worlde shoue and vnder

Our crysten hoost made them bowne
Kynge Rycharde nothynge them adradde
To his folke hors and harnes he gradde
He sayd felawes for the rood
Loke ye be of comforte good
For we gete the pryce this daye
Of hethenes all the noblaye
For euermore we haue wonne

But I this daye mete hym wele

An heed of a blacke sarasyne
Thorugh goddes helpe and myne
Suche worke I wyll amonge them make
Of tho that I may ouertake
That fro this tyme to domes daye
They shall speke of my paye
Euery crysten man was armed wele
Bothe in Iren and eke in stele
The kynge of fraunce with his batayll
Was redy the sarasynes to assayll
And aboue the sarasynes they rode
Sheltrons pyght and batayll abode
And forstopped the londe weyes
That they myght not flee the countreyes
Neyther no socoure to them come
But they were slayne or nome
The frensshe men dyde boost make
To slee sarasyne and crownes crake
But in Iestes as it is tolde
There was none of them so bolde
To nygh the sarasynes sheltrone
Tyll kynge Rycharde was I come
Now cometh Rycharde with his hoost
And closed them by an other coost
Bytwene them and the cyte
That none of them myght flee

But they wolde to the ryuer gone
Or elles the crysten sholde them slone
Than had Rycharde hoostes thre
That one gaue assaute to the cyte
The seconde with hym he ladde
To brynge his hors he badde
That the sowdan had hym sente
He sayd with his owne presente
I shall hym mete longe or nyght
He lepte on hors whan it was lyght
Or he in his sadell dyde lepe
Of many thynges he toke kepe
He lacked nought that he ne had
His men brought hym that he bad
A square tree of fourty fete
Before his sadell anone he it sete
Faste that they sholde it brase
That it fayled for no case
And so they dyde with hokes of Iren
And good rynges that wolde duren
Other fastenynge none there was
But Iren chaynes for all that cas
And they were wrought full well
Bothe his gyrthes and his ptytrell
And a queyntyse of the kynges owne
Upon his hors was throwne
Before his arson an axe of stele
And on that other syde a maswele
Hymselfe was rychely begone

The sarasynes fledde and wente mate
Full faste out at the castell gate
In herte they were full of sorowe

But foure hondred or fyue
They were soone brought of out lyue
They lepte on theyr destreres
And at the gate set porters
Kynge Rycharde lepte on fauell
Well armed in yren and in stele
And rode hym out at the gate
The kynge of egypte he merte therate
With syxty thousande of sarasynes fers
With armes bryght and brode baners
Rycharde a duke on the helme hytte
Downe to the grounde he hym slytte
Another he smote on the yren hode
That at his breste his swerde stode
His templers and his barons
Fared ryght lyke wood lyons
And slewe the sarasynes swythe
As grasse falleth before the sythe
The sarasynes sawe no better wone
But fledde awaye euerychone
To Salandynes grete hoost
That fyftene myle laye in coost
Syxty thousange as I you saye
The sowdan loste that same daye
For theyr armure fared as waxe

Yelded them to Rycharde our kynge
Rycharde put them in hostage tho
There were a thousande prysoners + mo
The chase lasted swythe longe
Tyll the tyme of euensonge

Rycharde rode after tyll it was nyght
So many of them to deth he dyght
That no nombre it may accounte
How many of them it wolde amounte
Rycharde lefte without the towne
And pyght there his pauylyowne
And that nyght with mylde herte
He comforted his barones smarte
And ye shall here on the morowe
How there was a daye of sorowe
For the gretest batayll I vnderstonde
That neuer was in ony londe
And ye that this batayll wyll lere
Herken now and ye shall here
As kynge Rycharde sate at his soupere
And gladded his barons with mylde chere
And comforted them with ale and wyne
Two messengers came frome Salandyn
And stode kynge Rycharde before
With longe berdes and with hore
Of two mules they were a lyght
In golde and sylke they were I dyght
Eyther helde other by the honde
And sayd kynge Rycharde now vnderstonde
Our lorde Salandyn the hygh kynge
Hath the sente this askynge
If that thou were so hardy a knyght
That thou durste hym abyde in fyght
Tyll to morowe that it daye ware
Of blysse thou sholde ben all bare

And in his hondes it all to rofe

For your counseyll and your rydynge

And though I were but my selfe alone

And come thou after with thy shypmen
For enemyes thou haste I vnderstonde
There in thyne owne londe

Rycharde arose as he wolde wede
ANd lepte on fauell his good stede
And sayd lordynges or sus or sus
Thus hath vs warned swete Ihesus
On armes he let crye thare
Ayenst the sarasynes for to fare
But Salandyn and his tem

That was to Rycharde moche payne
That he ne myght his hoost ordayne
Before he prycked on fauell
His spere dyde byte full well
Therwith he slewe without doute
Thre kynges of the sowdans route
His hors was styffe hymselfe was good
Hors ne man hym nought withstood
For to hewe many an hethen cors
He dyde his myght and his hors
He that had seen his countenaunce
Wolde hym haue had in remembraunce
They gan on hym as faste dryue
As bees done from the hony hyue
Whome that he hytte with his sworde
Neuer after ne spake he worde

The englysshe and frensshe gan after ryde
To fyght they were fresshe that tyde
Upon the sarasynes faste they donge
With swedes and with launces stronge
And smote harde with theyr myght
And slewe the sarasynes downe ryght
And there was full lytell kepe
So many of them were layde on slepe
That no slaughter without fayle
Ne myght ben seen in that batayle
A myre there was without Iaffe
A myle longe without lasse
Maugre them kynge Rycharde that syre
Thre thousande droue in to the myre
The foule cursed hethen men
Lye and bathe them in the fen
And tho that wolde come vp
Dranke of Rychardes owne cup
What adreynt and what I slawe
The sowdan lost of the hethen lawe
Syxty thousande in a lytell stounde
In the frensshe it is Ifounde
Tho kynge Rycharde wente ayen
To recomforte hym with his men
Now he was here now he was there
To helpe them with his powere
Ne sawe men neuer as I you tell
One man so many to grounde fell
And in the moost peryll of the batayle

The sarasynes had hym vnderhonde
To slee hym faste they gan fonde
It had ben his daye laste
Had not Rycharde comen in haste
Rycharde cryed with an hye voyse
A helpe god and the holy croyse
Mym eem to daye fro shame thou shylde
Frome deth of these dogges wylde
Lordynges he sayd laye on
Ne let these dogges escape non
I my selfe shall proue to smyte
If my pollaxe wyll ought byte
Tho men myght se with mayne
How he shedde blode and brayne
Upon the place that grene was
Many a soule wente to sathanas
The templers came to socoure
There began an harde shoure
They layde on as they were wode
The valeys ranne all on blode
The longe spaye was a doughty knyght
As he were wode he gan to fyght
The kynge of martok he mette in the felde
With a spere he smote hym in the shelde
That he tombled without fayle 
Toppe sayle ouer his hors tayle
That on his heed he lyght
And brake his necke I you plyght
The erle of leycester syr Robarde
The erle of rychemonde + kynge Rycharde
There as these thre knyghtes rode
That daye was othe waye all brode

That foure carters myght mete 
So many of them there lost the swete 
On bothe partyes was many a body 
Slayne that was full hardy 
At the laste with grete payne 
They wanne the erle of champayne 
And brought hym vpon his stede 
That swythe good was at nede 
And bad he sholde by hym ryde 
Ryght by his owne syde 
With that came a messenger reke 
With kynge Rycharde for to speke 
And sayd syr for charyte 
Tourne agayne to Iaffe cyte 
Couered is both mount and playne

And slewe fauell vnder hym 
Tho was Rycharde wroth + grym 
His axe from the arson he drewe 
The sarasynes therwith he slewe 
That had stycked vnder hym his stede 
Therfore they lost theyr hedes to mede 
On fote he was and on fote he layed 
Many an hondred vnder hym dayed 
All that his axe take myght 
Downe he slewe anone ryght 
What before and what behynde 
A thousande sarasynes in boke I fynde
He slewe whan he was on fote 
That came there neuer none to bote 
Salandynes two sones came ryde 
And ten thousande sarasynes by theyr syde 
And began to crye to kynge Rycharde 
Yelde the traytour thou foule cowarde 
Or we shall the slee in this place 
Thou lyest quod Rycharde by goddes grace 
And with his axe he smote hym so 
That his myddell he carued in two 
There halfe the body fell downe 
And that other halfe abode in the arsowne
Of the sayd Rycharde I am syker 
His broder came to that byker 
Upon a stede with grete raundowne 
As though the worlde sholde fall downe 
And gaue Rycharde a wou[n]de thorough the arme 
That dyde Rycharde moche harme 
For onthe spere heed was venym 
And Rycharde stoutely smote to hym 

440jpg

That hors and man he felde to grounde
Lye there quod Rycharde hethen hounde
Ne shalte thou neuer tell Salandyne
That thou dydest me my lyfe to ryne
Than fyue dukes of hethenesse
Came with theyr hoost more and lesse
And beset aboute Rycharde our kynge
And thought all to deth hym brynge
But Rycharde within a lytell thrawe
The fyue dukes he hath I slawe
And many an hondred after then
All swythe doughty hethen men
At the last though it were late
Rycharde wanne to Iaffe gate
Tho were our crysten well syker
That they sholde wynne that byker
The erle of leycester syr Robarde
Brought hym his stede lyarde
Kynge Rycharde in the sadell dyde lepe
Tho fledde the sarasynes ryght as shepe
Rycharde rode after tyll it was nyght
And slwere all that he take myght
There was slayne in playne and den
Ten hondred thousande hethen men
Tho myght Rycharde without leas
Wende to the cyte of Jaffe in peas
Tho he thanked the kynge of glorye
And Marye of that vyctorye
For syth the worlde was begonne
A fayrer batayle was neuer wonne
On the morowe he sente syr Sabeuyle

Peas made with the sowdan 
And syth he came I vnderstonde
The waye towarde englonde 
And thorugh treason was shotte alas
At castell gaylarde there he was 
The duke of estryche in the castell 
With his hoost was dyght full well 
Rycharde thought there to abyde 
The weder was hote in somer tyde 
At gaylarde vnder the castell
He wende he myght haue keled hym well 
His helme he abbated thare 
And made his vysage all bare 
A spye there was in the castell 
That espyed Rycharde ryght well
And toke an arblaste swythe stronge 
And a quarell that was well longe 
And smote kynge Rycharde in tene 
In the heed without wene 
Rycharde let his helme downe fall 
And badde his men dyght them all 
And swore by the see and the sonne 
Tyll the castell were Iwonne

443jpg

He sholde neyther mete ne drynke 
Neuer in to his body synke 
He set vp robynet that tyde 
Upon the castelles syde 
And on that other halfe the one 
He set vp the matgryffone
To the castell he threwe stones 
And brake the walles for the nones 
And so within a lytell tyde 
In to the castell they gan ryde 
And slewe before and behynde 
All tho that they myght ayenst them fynde 
And euer was the quarell by the lede 
Stycked styll in Rychardes hede 
And whan it was drawen out 
He dyed soone without doute 
And he co[m]maunded in all thynge
To his fader men sholde hym brynge 
That they ne let for nesshe ne harde 
Tyll he were at the font euerarde 
At font euerarde wytterly 
His bones lye his fader by 
Kynge Harry forsothe he hyght 
All englonde he helde to ryght 
Kynge Rycharde was a conquerour 
God gyue his soule moche honour 
No more of hym in englysshe is wrought 
But Ihesu that vs dere bought 
Gaunte his soule rest and ro 
And ours whan it cometh thereto 
And that it may so be 
Saye all amen for charyte
