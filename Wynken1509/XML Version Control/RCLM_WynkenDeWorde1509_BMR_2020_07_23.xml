The narrator here refers to the French "rymes" (l. 21) that were not known in England because "lewde man can frensshe none / of an hondred vnneth one" (l. 23-24), or roughly "lewed/unlearned men can [read] in French none of a hundred difficult ones."

Brought hym his stede lyarde
Kynge Rycharde in the sadell dyde lepe
Tho fledde the sarasynes ryght as shepe
Rycharde rode after tyll it was nyght
And slwere all that he take myght
There was slayne in playne and den
Ten hondred thousande hethen men
Tho myght Rycharde without leas
Wende to the cyte of Jaffe in peas
Tho he thanked the kynge of glorye
And Marye of that vyctorye
For syth the worlde was begonne
A fayrer batayle was neuer wonne
On the morowe he sente syr Sabeuyle
And syr Roberte of waturuyle

And toke an arblaste swythe stronge 
And a quarell that was well longe 
And smote kynge Rycharde in tene

And badde his men dyght them all 
And swore by the see and the sonne 
Tyll the castell were Iwonne

Neuer in to his body synke 
He set vp robynet that tyde 
Upon the castelles syde 
And on that other halfe the one 
He set vp the matgryffone
To the castell he threwe stones 
And brake the walles for the nones 
And so within a lytell tyde 
In to the castell they gan ryde 
And slewe before and behynde 
All tho that they myght ayenst them fynde 
And euer was the quarell by the lede 
Stycked styll in Rychardes hede 
And whan it was drawen out 
He dyed soone without doute 
And he co[m]maunded in all thynge
To his fader men sholde hym brynge 
That they ne let for nesshe ne harde 
Tyll he were at the font euerarde 
At font euerarde wytterly 
His bones lye his fader by 
Kynge Harry forsothe he hyght 
All englonde he helde to ryght 
Kynge Rycharde was a conquerour 
God gyue his soule moche honour 
No more of hym in englysshe is wrought 
But Ihesu that vs dere bought 
Gaunte his soule rest and ro 
And ours whan it cometh thereto 
And that it may so be 
Saye all amen for charyte
