Could Artys be a corruption of Acre? We could also have mistranscribed it, but &quot;Arcys&quot; is an unlikely transcription.-->
ffro thennes in to chascidone . <note type="expl" resp="#LKN" corresp="harley4690_105">Chalcedon, a city across the Bosporus from Constantinople (now Istanbul) on the coast of the Sea of Marmara, which crusaders and pilgrims headed to Jerusalem frequented. Durint the so-called First Crusade, for example, Godfrey de Bouillon and his army were transported to Chalcedon after a sojourn in Constantinople and made thier way from there (See Runciman, <emph rend="italic">A History of the Crusades</emph>, vol. 1, 152).</note>
And to the cite Babilone <note type="expl" resp="#LKN" corresp="harley4690_106">Babylon was a common name for the Egyptian city Cairo in the Middle Ages, but could also refer to Egypt itself at this time. According to Andrew Scheil, &quot;[t]he Egyptian location is the town of fortress of Bāb-al-yūn (Arabic: &quot;the city of On,&quot; derived from the earlier &quot;Pi-Hapi-n-On&quot; of the Pharaohs)...; Cairo itself was founded in 969 CE and the two places eventually merged and today are part of Old Cairo. Understandably, Arabic &quot;Bab-al-yun&quot; was rendered as &quot;Babylon&quot; early in the Western tradition; thus in a wide variety of medieval texts-particularly beginning with the crusades-Cairo, Alexandria, Memphis, or Egypt could be called &quot;Babylon&quot; and their lord the &quot;Sultan of Babylon&quot; (<emph rend="italic">Babylon Under Western Eyes: A Study of Allusion and Myth</emph>, 258).</note>
And to the cite of Sesare . <note type="expl" resp="#LKN" corresp="harley4690_107">Cesarea, a city on the Sharon plain (HaSharon in Hebrew) between the Mediterranean coast and the Samarian Hills. The Byzantine Empire lost control of the city in 640 CE when it was taken by 'Amr ibn al-'As and his Rashidun army during the Al-Faṫṫḥul-Islāmiyyuash-Shām (&quot;The Muslim Conquest of the Levant&quot;). The city was taken by Baldwin I of Jerusalem and his army in 1101, shortly after the conquest of Jerusalem. Salah ad-Din conquered the city in 1187, and Richard I conquered the city in 1191 during the so-called Third Crusade.</note>
and to the cite of Jer[usa]l[e]m . <note type="text" resp="#LKN" corresp="harley4690_108">This has to be an abbreviation for Jerusalem, but it is unusual. Moreover, unlike other witnesses, the rhyme scheme is broken between the lines ending with Cesare and Jerusalem because there appears to be a &quot;missing&quot; line. Brunner, in fact, writes &quot;fehlt&quot; (i.e. &quot;is missing&quot;) in his note for this line (pg. 111, n. 638), which in other versions refers to the city of Nineva and ends with the word &quot;ware.&quot; Based on the break in rhyme, this is very likely an eye-skip on the part of the copyist.</note>
To Betayne and to Bedleem . <note type="expl" resp="#LKN" corresp="harley4690_109">Bethany and Bethlehem are both towns on the West Bank and would have registered as significant because of the former's associations with Lazarus (who hailed from Bethany and who Christ raises from the dead in the gospels) and because of the latter being the place of Christ's birth.</note>
and to the cite of Sudranturpẏe <note type="expl" resp="#LKN" corresp="harley4690_110">A variant spelling of &quot;Sudan Turry,&quot; which presumably refers to Sidon and Tyre.</note>
and to the cite of Ebedẏe . <note type="expl" resp="#LKN" corresp="harley4690_111">This perhaps refers to the city of Ebron/Hebron. Both Brunner and Larkin suggest as much.</note>
and to the castell of Orglyous . <note type="expl" resp="#LKN" corresp="harley4690_112">The Castle of Pride, also fictional. As Peter Larkin suggests, this city name &quot;evokes romance castles&quot; (Larkin, n. 643). See also Andrew Scheil's discussion of this catalogue (<emph rend="italic">Baylon Under Western Eyes</emph>, 269-71).</note>
and to the cite of peryeus . <note type="expl" resp="#LKN" corresp="harley4690_113">Possibly the port city Piraeus in Attica, Greece; if so, this name seems out of place since the place names before and after this line are in Outremer.</note>
To Japhes and to saffrane <note type="expl" resp="#LKN #SLG" corresp="harley4690_114">Jaffa is a port city serving Jerusalem (Larkin n. 5930). There, in 1192 CE, Richard and Salah ad-Din signed a peace treaty that ended the so-called Third Crusade. The length of the treaty is unclear: some crusades historians write that it called for a five-year truce, while others maintain it was only three. See Runciman, <emph rend="italic">A History of the Crusades</emph>, vol. 3, 71-73; Venning and Frankopan, <emph rend="italic">A Chronology of the Crusades</emph>, 215; and Moynihan, &quot;Peacemaking and holy war: Christian-Muslim diplomacy, c. 1095-1291, in crusades historiography&quot;, 3. Larkin suggests that Safrane may refer to Sephoria (also spelled Sepphoris), a town in Galilee (see Larkin n. for 645). According to Runciman, Salah ad-Din retreated towards Sephoria following the surrender of Acre to Richard's forces in 1191 CE (Runciman, 50).</note>
to taburet and to Archane . <note type="expl" resp="#LKN #SLG" corresp="harley4690_115">Larkin suggests that Taburet is &quot;likely a reference to Tiberias, a city on the Sea of Galilee&quot;. After the so-called First Crusade, in which Jerusalem was captured by Christian forces, it became part of the Principality of Galilee under Tancred, who is a character in this witness and first appears on line 586. Larkin, along with Loomis, suggests that Archane refers to Archas, a town in Libya. See Larkin, n. 646.</note>

While the historical King Richard was imprisoned in Germany, this occurred on his return from Outremer, not before it.

There is no indication, however, that the scribe skipped three whole lines, and so it seems equally if not moreso likely that the omission was deliberate or that the lines were also absent from the version used by the copyist of Harley 4690.

Either way though, you should absolutely write up a textual note!--><!-- SNM trans: there is an odd extra stroke after the r in [serante] that makes me think perhaps the scribe intended another character there. A v makes the most sense, but it is definetly not a fully-formed v-->
