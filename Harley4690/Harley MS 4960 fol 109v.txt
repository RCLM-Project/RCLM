Al in palmeren gẏse <!--LKN expl: The term "palmer" referred specifically to a pilgrim bound for Jerusalem. The term referred to the badge that such a pilgrim would wear as a sign of their intended destination; pilgrims bound for Jerusalem wore a palm badge that recalled Christ's celebrated entry into Jerusalem prior to his crucifixion. The term "guise" here, however, makes it very clear that Richard and his fellow knights are not pilgrims in earnest but that they plan to disguise themselves as such in order to embark on a reconaissance mission that will aid them in their later crusading endeavors.-->

ffro thennes in to chascidone. <!--LKN expl: Chalcedon, a city across the Bosporus from Constantinople (now Istanbul) on the coast of the Sea of Marmara, which crusaders and pilgrims headed to Jerusalem frequented. Durint the so-called First Crusade, for example, Godfrey de Bouillon and his army were transported to Chalcedon after a sojourn in Constantinople and made thier way from there (See Runciman, A History of the Crusades, vol. 1, 152) -->
And to the cite of Babilone <!--LKN expl: Babylon was a common name for the Egyptian city Cairo in the Middle Ages, but could also refer to Egypt itself at this time. According to Andrew Scheil, "[t]he Egyptian location is the town of fortress of Bāb-al-yūn (Arabic: "the city of On," derived from the earlier "Pi-Hapi-n-On" of the Pharaohs)...; Cairo itself was founded in 969 CE and the two places eventually merged and today are part of Old Cairo. Understandably, Arabic 'Bab-al-yun' was rendered as 'Babylon' early in the Western tradition; thus in a wide variety of medieval texts-particularly beginning with the crusades-Cairo, Alexandria, Memphis, or Egypt could be called "Babylon" and their lord the "Sultan of Babylon" (<i>Babylon Under Western Eyes: A Study of Allusion and Myth</i>, 258)-->
And to the cite of Sesare. <!--LKN expl: Cesarea, a city on the Sharon plain (HaSharon in Hebrew) between the Mediterranean coast and the Samarian Hills. The Byzantine Empire lost control of the city in 640 CE when it was taken by 'Amr ibn al-'As and his Rashidun army during the Al-Faṫṫḥul-Islāmiyyuash-Shām ("The Muslim Conquest of the Levant") The city was taken by Baldwin I of Jerusalem and his army in 1101, shortly after the conquest of Jerusalem. Salah ad-Din conquered the city in 1187, and Richard I conquered the city in 1191 during the so-called Third Crusade.-->
And to the cite of Jer[usalem].  <!--LKN text: potential t-note. This has to be an abbreviation for Jerusalem, but it is unusual. Also of note, perhaps, is that unlike other witnesses, the rhyme scheme is broken between the lines ending with Cesare and Jerusalem because there appears to be a “missing” line. Brunner, in fact, writes “fehlt” (i.e. “is missing”) in his note for this line (pg. 111, n. 638), which in other versions refers to the city of Nineva and ends with the word “ware.” Based on the break in rhyme, this is very likely an eye-skip on the part of the copyist.-->
To Betayne and to Bedleem <!--LKN expl: Bethany and Bethlehem are both towns on the West Bank and woudl have registered as significant because of the former's associations with Lazarus (who hailed from Bethany and who Christ raises from the dead in the gospels) and because of the latter being the place of Christ's birth.-->
and to the cite of Sudranturpẏs <!--LKN expl: A variant spelling of "Sudan Turry," which presumably refers to Sidon and Tyre-->
and to the cite of Ebedẏe. <!--LKN expl: this perhaps refers to the city of Ebron/Hebron. Both Brunner and Larkin suggest as much.-->
and to the castell of Orglyous.<!--LKN expl: The Castle of Pride, also fictional. As Peter Larkin suggests, this city name "evokes romance castles" (Larkin n. for 643). See also Andrew Scheil's discussion of this catalogue, (<i>Baylon Under Western Eyes</i>, 269-71)-->
and to the cite of peryeus. <!--LKN expl: possibly the port city Piraeus in Attica, Greece; if so, this name seems out of place since the place names before and after this line are in Outremer.-->
To Japhes and to saffrane<!--LKN expl: provide note on Jaffa and Safrane, Larkin n. 645-->
to taburet and to Archane. <!--LKN expl: provide note on Tiberias and Archas, Larkin n. 646-->

While the historical King Richard was imprisoned in Germany, this occurred on his return from Outremer, not before it. To the best of our knowledge, the historical Richard did not kill the king's son, sleep with the king's daughter, and kill a lion with his bare hands while a prisoner.-->
