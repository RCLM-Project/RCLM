Understandably, Arabic 'Bab-al-yun' was rendered as 'Babylon' early in the Western tradition; thus in a wide variety of medieval texts-particularly beginning with the crusades-Cairo, Alexandria, Memphis, or Egypt could be called "Babylon" and their lord the "Sultan of Babylon" (<i>Babylon Under Western Eyes: A Study of Allusion and Myth</i>, 258)-->

This has to be an abbreviation for Jerusalem, but it is unusual. Also of note, perhaps, is that unlike other witnesses, the rhyme scheme is broken between the lines ending with Cesare and Jerusalem because there appears to be a “missing” line. Brunner, in fact, writes “fehlt” (i.e. “is missing”) in his note for this line (pg. 111, n. 638), which in other versions refers to the city of Nineva and ends with the word “ware.” Based on the break in rhyme, this is very likely an eye-skip on the part of the copyist.-->
