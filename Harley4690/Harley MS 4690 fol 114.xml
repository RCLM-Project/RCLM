Lines like this have led Brunner et al to posit the existence of a now lost French original, but this could also just as easily be an example of a popular rhetorical flourish gesture ment to amplify the storyteller´s auctoritas. Provide a source or two on these kinds of maneuvers here also.-->

sche sende hẏm maẏde Belẏne<!--LKN expl: need note on Belyne here, especially since this is either a different figure altogether or a very creative alternate spelling of Berengaria of Navarre, and this latter option seems likliest based on the evocation of Navarre in the following line. Should also go ahead and provide note on Navarre here.-->

There is no indication, however, that the scribe skipped three whole lines, and so it seems equally if not moreso likely that the omission was deliberate or that the lines were also absent from the version used by the copyist of Harley 4690. This is significant, because the latter suggests a possible and deliberate elision of Eleanor from a more historical version of RCL. Must also figure out who in the hell Johan is.-->
