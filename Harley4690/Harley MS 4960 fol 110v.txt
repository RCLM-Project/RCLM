fol. 110v

Till that other day atte prime
the kyngges sone come that tyme .
Ardour was is right name
he thought to do kyng Richarde schame .
ffor he was holden y understonde
the strengest man of alle þat londe .
To the porter thenne seide hæ
alle þi[s] prisoners þ[ou] lette me see . <!---LKN text: there is an abbreviation mark above the &quot;þi,&quot; but Brunner does not account for it in his edition. My guess is that it&#39;s meant to be expanded with an &quot;s&quot; at the end, but would like to hear your thoughts also!-->
the porter seide syr atte thy wille
youre commawndement y schall fylle .
he bronght hem fforthe sone anone
and Richarde ganne fformost gone .
the emperour ys sone hym vndernam
Art thow Richard þe strong manne .
as men seyen in euery londe
Durste þu stonde a boffete of my honde <!--LKN text: Brunner transcribes as &quot;boffett&quot; but the final letter looks much more like an &quot;e.&quot; would welcome your takes on this! If you agree, this should be a t-note-->
and y schalle youe the leue
A nother boffette me to yeve <!--LKN text: Note for those doing transcription check: this took me a little while to sort out, but the last word of this line is, in fact, leve (if you look at the v in &quot;devise&quot; on line 66 of this version, which is a handful of lines down on the first colum of 109v, it becomes a lot easier to see in this line)-->
hastely kyng Richarde
G[ra]unted hym in that fforwarde .
the emperour is sone bothe fers [and] prout
yaff to Rych[arde] a swithe sore cloute .
the fyre of is yen oute sprangge .
Richard þought he dude hym wrong
y the swere by seint Gymelyne <!--LKN expl: need a note on the saint-->
to morowe þis tyme y schall pay þine
þe Emperour is sone on hym lougys <!--LKN text: something strange is going on with that last word. Should be &quot;laugh&quot; but the spelling here is strange at best. Wondering if that second to last character (which looks like a y) was meant to be an H instead? Wondering too about the mark above the y for that matter . . . -->
and seid he schold haue is wille y nough .
Bothe of drinke and of mete .
of the beste he wolde ete .
that he durst itte notte wite
ffor ffebylnesse ys dynte to quyte .
On the morwne whanne itte was day
Richard aris w[ith] outen delay
And a fuyre he dydde hym dyghte
and towke wexe fayre and bryghte
By the fuyre he wexed is honde
alle aboute y vnderstonde .
he made is honde well and slyghte .
to holde þe payement þ[at] he behighte .
þe Emperour ys sone come thanne
...e kepe forwarde as a trow manne
...d byfore kyngge Richarde stode .

and speke to hyme w[ith] sterne mode .
smyte Richarde w[ith] alle þy myghte
as þu arte a stalleworth. knyghte
and iffe y stoupe other ffelde

Vnder is cheke is honde he leide
he that itte sighe the sothe seide
fflesche and skynne awey he drowghte
and to grownde he fell ynne sowghe
a too was Broke is cheke bone
Wordes spake he neuer none.
alle þus k[ing] Richard paidd is buffette
God ȝew ys soule hevenne parte. <!--LKN text: Brunner adds &quot;in&quot; before heaven, as the scribe seems to have left that preposition out in error-->
to the Emperour a knyght gan renne <!--LKN text: the word knyght is spelled &quot;kmyght&quot; in the manuscript, as the scribe seems to have accidentally included an extra minim after the n.-->
and tolde hym of this tydyngge
that Richard had is sone y slawe
and y Brought hym of is lyue dawe.
Alas seide þe Emperour nough hane y non
[and] with that worde he felle in sowne

And seid syr ne dysmaye ȝowghe
The emperour bade on hyghe

Stylle þeighe stode euerychone .
ffor sorowe ne myght þey telle none

Alas sche seide wate may þis baene .
Why is þis sorow and this fare

A madame ne wyste ȝe noughte
