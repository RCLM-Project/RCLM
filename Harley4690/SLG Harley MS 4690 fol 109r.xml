<!-- SLG: I know I need entities for thorn, yogh, and ydot, but don't know what that means or how to include them in the document.-->
<!-- SLG: still need to encode names and places-->

<!-- CMP: Hi SLG! So, there are 3 really important things to know about working with XML. w3schools has some great information and activities if you want to do some abstract thinking (https://www.w3schools.com/xml/), but all XML is (1) extensible (2) well-formed (3) validated. Extensible basically means it can be extended or modified; well-formed means that all tags must be properly opened and closed within their nested treets; validation is a process to confirm that everything is well-formed according to a schema. We are using the TEI schema from the Text Encoding Initiative to define our mark-up practices. You can explore the TEI here (https://tei-c.org/) and spend some time reviewing the P5 guidelines (from which the RCLM guidelines are developed). You might also review the Gentle Introduction to XML from the TEI (https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html).   -->

Supplying Larkin’s note here for now since we’ll want to draw on it and Finlayson, who he references: 399 Fouke Doly. Of undoubted historicity, Fulk D’Oilly and Thomas Moulton (line 433) were Lincolnshire knights connected by marriage in the thirteenth century. As they do not appear in chronicles of the Third Crusade, Finalyson suggests that the large role these knights play in RCL’s a version represents an early redactor’s efforts “to glorify his or a patron’s family,” since the names do not occur in L, the fragment that Finlayson believes to contain the story’s basic form (“‘Richard, Coer de Lyon,’” p. 166; and “Legendary Ancestors”) (METS RCL, n. 399)-->
